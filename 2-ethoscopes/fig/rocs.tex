  	Comparison between algorithmic results and a ground truth of 1297 human annotations.
  	\textbf{A},~Distribution of the Euclidean distances between tracking and human annotations.
	\textbf{B},~ROC curves for movement and walking classifiers.
	Relationship between true positive rate (TPR) for false positive rate (FPR) for variable thresholds $T$.
	The blue and red curves are for \rev{a threshold of} the movement \rev{($T_m$)} and the walking \rev{($T_w$)} detectors, respectively. 
	The dots and label show the values of \rev{the selected} thresholds \rev{$T^*$} that correspond to `conservative' FPRs of 0.005.
