  \caption[The ethoscope platform]{\ctit{The ethoscope platform.}
  	\textbf{A},~Schematic representation of the hardware components of the ethoscope platform.
  	It contains multiple ethoscopes and a single `node'.
  	Each device is a standalone tracking unit that processes video on-board. 
  	In the laboratory, the devices communicate through a custom wireless network.
	\textbf{B},~Software side of ethoscope platform.
	The node runs three main services: 
	the `node server' to list and control ethoscopes though a web interface,
	the  `backup server' to save experimental results and 
	the `update server' to maintain the platform.
	The ethoscope devices run the `ethoscope server' that performs video tracking and exposes their status, in real time, to allow for quality control.
	They can also be maintained through their own `update server'.
	Data is saved on a \texttt{MySQL} database by each ethoscope, and mirrored as an \texttt{SQLite .db} file on the node side.
