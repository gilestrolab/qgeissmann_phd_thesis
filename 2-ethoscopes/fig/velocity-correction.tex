  	\textbf{A},~Distribution of the maximal velocity in all animals and 10~s epochs at different FPS.
  	The dashed line indicates the different movement detection threshold obtained.
  	Only three frame rates are shown for the sake of simplicity.
	\textbf{B},~Regression between the obtained threshold and the eight different frame rate tested (all obtained by resampling the reference video).
	\textbf{C},~Distribution of the \emph{corrected} maximal velocity in all animals and 10s epochs the same FPS as in \textbf{A}.
	Correction was performed using equation~\ref{eq:velocor2}.
