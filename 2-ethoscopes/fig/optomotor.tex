  	\textbf{A}, Drawing of the optomotor attached to an ethoscope. 
  	A USB cable (not shown) allows the communication between ethoscope and to the module.
  	\textbf{B}, Picture of a module built without optic fibres (motors only) loaded with experimental tubes. 
  	Each other tube rests on top of the shaft of a small motor.
  	Motors can be controlled individually, in real time, to startle specific animals  by spinning their tubes (green arrows).
	The module can also be assembled with LED lights and optical fibres so that light can be guided inside each tube.
