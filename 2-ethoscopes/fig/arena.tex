  \caption[Sleep arena]{\ctit{Sleep arena.}
  	The behavioural arena designed to study sleep. It holds twenty fruit flies in individual $70 \times{} 5 \times{} 3$mm ($L\times{}OD\times{}ID$) glass tubes.
 	 \textbf{A}, Drawing of an experimental arena and a single glass tube.
 	 \textbf{B} Image of the arena taken by the device's camera (original size 1280x960pixel). 
The frame is artificially split into two parts by a dashed line: the left (white bar) and right (black bar) sides represent two portions of the same arena taken either during \gls{l} and \gls{d} phases, respectively. 
One of the twenty \glspl{roi} is shown to illustrate the coordinate system within each \gls{roi}.
