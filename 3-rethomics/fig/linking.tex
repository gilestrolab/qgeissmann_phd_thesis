\textbf{A}, Linking. The mandatory fields in the user-provided metadata are used to automatically locate the corresponding files.
Location data is stored as an additional field. This process also checks for existence and  integrity of the data.
Individuals are also automatically allocated a unique identifier during this process.
\textbf{B}, Loading. 
The linked metadata is then used to fetch and optionally pre-process data.
All data is grouped and eventually stored, with the metadata in a single \texttt{behavr} object.
