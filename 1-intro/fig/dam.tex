		\textbf{A}: a Drosophila Activity Monitor (DAM), the most widely used system to monitor walking activity and sleep in \droso, with 8 tubes loaded.
		Each monitor can hold up to 32 single flies in glass tubes.
		Multiple monitors can run in parallel, and their data is centralised on an acquisition computer.
		\textbf{B}: Schematic of a single tube ($\approx 70$~mm long) showing the underlying mechanism of the DAM.
		Each fly is contained between food on one side and cotton wool on the other. 
		Tubes are sealed with paraffin wax.
		When the fly walks through the midline of its tube, it crosses an infrared beam which is detected as movement.
		The numbers of beam crosses are generally aggregated over one minute (\ie{} the resulting sampling rate being 1~min$^{-1}$).
