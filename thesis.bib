Our system includes machine-vision algorithms that accurately track many individuals without swapping identities and classification algorithms that detect behaviors. The data may be represented as an ethogram that plots the time course of behaviors exhibited by each fly or as a vector that concisely captures the statistical properties of all behaviors displayed in a given period. We found that behavioral differences between individuals were consistent over time and were sufficient to accurately predict gender and genotype. In addition, we found that the relative positions of flies during social interactions vary according to gender, genotype and social environment. We expect that our software, which permits high-throughput screening, will complement existing molecular methods available in Drosophila, facilitating new investigations into the genetic and cellular basis of behavior.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0037250},
  abstract = {Drosophila melanogaster has been used for decades in the study of circadian behavior, and more recently has become a popular model for the study of sleep. The classic method for monitoring fly activity involves counting the number of infrared beam crosses in individual small glass tubes. Incident recording methods such as this can measure gross locomotor activity, but they are unable to provide details about where the fly is located in space and do not detect small movements (i.e. anything less than half the enclosure size), which could lead to an overestimation of sleep and an inaccurate report of the behavior of the fly. This is especially problematic if the fly is awake, but is not moving distances that span the enclosure. Similarly, locomotor deficiencies could be incorrectly classified as sleep phenotypes. To address these issues, we have developed a locomotor tracking technique (the ``Tracker'' program) that records the exact location of a fly in real time. This allows for the detection of very small movements at any location within the tube. In addition to circadian locomotor activity, we are able to collect other information, such as distance, speed, food proximity, place preference, and multiple additional parameters that relate to sleep structure. Direct comparisons of incident recording and our motion tracking application using wild type and locomotor-deficient (CASK-$\beta$ null) flies show that the increased temporal resolution in the data from the Tracker program can greatly affect the interpretation of the state of the fly. This is especially evident when a particular condition or genotype has strong effects on the behavior, and can provide a wealth of information previously unavailable to the investigator. The interaction of sleep with other behaviors can also be assessed directly in many cases with this method.},

Our system monitors interacting pairs of flies, and computes their location, orientation and wing posture. These features are used for detecting behaviors exhibited during aggression and courtship. Among these, wing threat, lunging and tussling are specific to aggression; circling, wing extension (courtship ``song'') and copulation are specific to courtship; locomotion and chasing are common to both. Ethograms may be constructed automatically from these measurements, saving considerable time and effort. This technology should enable large-scale screens for genes and neural circuits controlling courtship and aggression.},

  volume = {31},
  issn = {0161-8105},
  abstract = {Study Objectives:
In order to characterize the genetic mechanisms underlying sleep, we have carried out a large-scale screen in Drosophila to identify short-sleeping mutants. The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) characterize the phenotypes of the shortest-sleeping mutants; (2) examine whether changes in arousal threshold or sleep homeostasis underlie short-sleeping phenotypes; (3) clone a gene affected in one of the shortest sleepers; and (4) investigate whether circadian mutants can be identified using light:dark (L:D) locomotor data obtained for studying sleep behavior.

Design:
Locomotor activity was measured using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring System in a 12:12 L:D cycle.

Setting:
Drosophila research laboratory.

Participants:
Adult flies from the 2nd chromosome Zuker collection, which contain mutations in most of the nonessential genes on the Drosophila 2nd chromosome.

Measurements and Results:
Our analysis of sleep characteristics suggests that daily activity (but not waking activity) correlates with daily sleep time and that defects in sleep maintenance are more common than defects in sleep initiation. Our shortest sleepers have intact or increased sleep rebound following sleep deprivation but show reduced thresholds for arousal. Molecular analysis of one of the short-sleeping lines indicates that it is a novel allele of a dopamine transporter (DAT). Finally, we describe a novel approach for identifying circadian mutants using L:D data.

Conclusions:
Our data suggest that most short-sleeping mutant phenotypes in Drosophila are characterized by an inability to stay asleep, most likely because of a reduced arousal threshold.

  abstract = {The neural circuits that regulate sleep and arousal as well as their integration with circadian circuits remain unclear, especially in Drosophila. This issue intersects with that of photoreception, because light is both an arousal signal in diurnal animals and an entraining signal for the circadian clock. To identify neurons and circuits relevant to light-mediated arousal as well as circadian phase-shifting, we developed genetic techniques that link behavior to single cell-type resolution within the Drosophila central brain. We focused on the unknown function of the 10 PDF-containing large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNvs) of the Drosophila circadian brain network and show here that these cells function in light-dependent arousal. They also are important for phase shifting in the late-night (dawn), indicating that the circadian photoresponse is a network property and therefore non-cell-autonomous. The data further indicate that the circuits underlying light-induced arousal and circadian photoentrainment intersect at the l-LNvs and then segregate.},

Such fragments overlap in a genomic region complementary to one transcript, a 4.5-kb RNA which is probably the per message, in that it is necessary and (in terms of expression from this X-chromosomal locus) sufficient for the fly's circadian rhythms. It is also at least necessary for the high-frequency oscillations normally produced by courting males as they vibrate their wings. The entirety of the 4.5-kb transcript is not necessary for rather strong rhythmicity; nor does it seem to be sufficient, in transformants, for wild-type behavioral phenotypes. A 0.9-kb RNA, homologous to genomic region immediately adjacent to the source of the 4.5-kb species, oscillates in its abundance over the course of a day; but coverage of this transcript source in several transformants carrying a per0 mutation\textendash{}which eliminates the 0.9-kb RNA's oscillation\textendash{}does not restore rhythmicity.

The amnesiac (amn) gene, encodes a neuropeptide that is homologous with vertebrate pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide (PACAP), is expressed in dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons and is required for the middle-term memory (MTM) in flies. However, the role of amn on regulation of sleep is as yet unknown. Here we provide evidence that amn plays a major role on sleep maintenance and onset in Drosophila. Flies with the amnesiac allele, loss-of-function amnX8 mutation, showed a fragmented sleep pattern and short sleep latency. Moreover, homeostatic regulation was disrupted in amnX8 mutants after sleep deprivation. Sleep maintenance was also influenced by disruption of neurotransmission in DPM neurons with increased sleep bout number and decreased sleep bout length. Furthermore, age-related sleep fragmentation and initiation were inhibited in amnX8 mutant flies. These data suggest that amn is required in initiation and maintenance of sleep. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

To identify candidate genes affecting sleep, we assayed 136 isogenic P-element insertion lines of Drosophila melanogaster. Since sleep has been negatively correlated with energy reserves across taxa, we measured energy stores (whole-body protein, glycogen, and triglycerides) in these lines as well. Twenty-one insertions with known effects on physiology, development, and behavior affect 24-hr sleep time. Thirty-two candidate insertions significantly impact energy stores. Mutational genetic correlations among sleep parameters revealed that the genetic basis of the transition between sleep and waking states in males and females may be different. Furthermore, sleep bout number can be decoupled from waking activity in males, but not in females. Significant genetic correlations are present between sleep phenotypes and glycogen stores in males, while sleep phenotypes are correlated with triglycerides in females. Differences observed in male and female sleep behavior in flies may therefore be related to sex-specific differences in metabolic needs. Sleep thus emerges as a complex trait that exhibits extensive pleiotropy and sex specificity. The large mutational target that we observed implicates genes functioning in a variety of biological processes, suggesting that sleep may serve a number of different functions rather than a single purpose.},

The Drosophila model for sleep provides a powerful system to address the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying sleep and wakefulness. Here we show that a Drosophila biogenic amine, octopamine, is a potent wake-promoting signal. Mutations in the octopamine biosynthesis pathway produced a phenotype of increased sleep, which was restored to wild-type levels by pharmacological treatment with octopamine. Moreover, electrical silencing of octopamine-producing cells decreased wakefulness, whereas excitation of these neurons promoted wakefulness. Because protein kinase A (PKA) is a putative target of octopamine signaling and is also implicated in Drosophila sleep, we investigated its role in the effects of octopamine on sleep. We found that decreased PKA activity in neurons rendered flies insensitive to the wake-promoting effects of octopamine. However, this effect of PKA was not exerted in the mushroom bodies, a site previously associated with PKA action on sleep. These studies identify a novel pathway that regulates sleep in Drosophila.},

Drosophila melanogaster is an important model for the study of metabolism and behaviour, however the effect of diet upon Drosophila sleep remains largely unaddressed. Methodology/Principal Findings Using automated behavioural monitoring, a capillary feeding assay and pharmacological treatments, we examined the effect of dietary yeast and sucrose upon Drosophila sleep-wake behaviour for three consecutive days. We found that dietary yeast deconsolidated the sleep-wake behaviour of flies by promoting arousal from sleep in males and shortening periods of locomotor activity in females. We also demonstrate that arousal from nocturnal sleep exhibits a significant ultradian rhythmicity with a periodicity of 85 minutes. Increasing the dietary sucrose concentration from 5\% to 35\% had no effect on total sucrose ingestion per day nor any affect on arousal, however it did lengthen the time that males and females remained active. Higher dietary sucrose led to reduced total sleep by male but not female flies. Locomotor activity was reduced by feeding flies Metformin, a drug that inhibits oxidative phosphorylation, however Metformin did not affect any aspects of sleep. Conclusions We conclude that arousal from sleep is under ultradian control and regulated in a sex-dependent manner by dietary yeast and that dietary sucrose regulates the length of time that flies sustain periods of wakefulness. These findings highlight Drosophila as an important model with which to understand how diet impacts upon sleep and wakefulness in mammals and humans.},

  abstract = {There are fundamental similarities between sleep in mammals and quiescence in the arthropod Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting that sleep-like states are evolutionarily ancient. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans also has a quiescent behavioural state during a period called lethargus, which occurs before each of the four moults. Like sleep, lethargus maintains a constant temporal relationship with the expression of the C. elegans Period homologue LIN-42 (ref. 5). Here we show that quiescence associated with lethargus has the additional sleep-like properties of reversibility, reduced responsiveness and homeostasis. We identify the cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) gene egl-4 as a regulator of sleep-like behaviour, and show that egl-4 functions in sensory neurons to promote the C. elegans sleep-like state. Conserved effects on sleep-like behaviour of homologous genes in C. elegans and Drosophila suggest a common genetic regulation of sleep-like states in arthropods and nematodes. Our results indicate that C. elegans is a suitable model system for the study of sleep regulation. The association of this C. elegans sleep-like state with developmental changes that occur with larval moults suggests that sleep may have evolved to allow for developmental changes.},

Arousal is generally ascertained by measures of movement complemented by brain activity recordings, which can provide signatures independently of movement activity. Here we examine the relationships among movement, arousal state, and local field potential (LFP) activity in the Drosophila brain. Results: We have measured the correlation between local field potentials (LFPs) in the brain and overt movements of the fruit fly during different states of arousal, such as spontaneous daytime waking movement, visual arousal, spontaneous night-time movement, and stimulus-induced movement. We found that the correlation strength between brain LFP activity and movement was dependent on behavioral state and, to some extent, on LFP frequency range. Brain activity and movement were uncoupled during the presentation of visual stimuli and also in the course of overnight experiments in the dark. Epochs of low correlation or uncoupling were predictive of increased arousal thresholds even in moving flies and thus define a distinct state of arousal intermediate between sleep and waking in the fruit fly. Conclusions: These experiments indicate that the relationship between brain LFPs and movement in the fruit fly is dynamic and that the degree of coupling between these two measures of activity defines distinct states of arousal.},

This can be quite disruptive and yet little is known about its underlying basis. To better understand the effects of aging on sleep:wake cycles, we sought to study this problem in Drosophila melanogaster, a powerful system for research on aging and behavior. By assaying flies of different ages as well as monitoring individual flies constantly over the course of their lifetime, we found that the strength of sleep:wake cycles decreased and that sleep became more fragmented with age in Drosophila. These changes in sleep:wake cycles became faster or slower with manipulations of ambient temperature that decreased or increased lifespan, respectively, demonstrating that they are a function of physiological rather than chronological age. The effect of temperature on lifespan was not mediated by changes in overall activity level or sleep amount. Flies treated with the oxidative stress-producing reagent paraquat showed a breakdown of sleep:wake cycles similar to that seen with aging, leading us to propose that the accumulation of oxidative damage with age contributes to the changes in rhythm and sleep. Together, these findings establish Drosophila as a valuable model for studying age-associated sleep fragmentation and breakdown of rhythm strength, and indicate that these changes in sleep:wake cycles are an integral part of the physiological aging process.},

  abstract = {Study Objectives: To use video to determine the accuracy of the infrared beam-splitting method for measuring sleep in Drosophila and to determine the effect of time of day, sex, genotype, and age on sleep measurements. Design: A digital image analysis method based on frame subtraction principle was developed to distinguish a quiescent from a moving fly. Data obtained using this method were compared with data obtained using the Drosophila Activity Monitoring System (DAMS). The location of the fly was identified based on its centroid location in the subtracted images. Measurements and Results: The error associated with the identification of total sleep using DAMS ranged from 7\% to 95\% and depended on genotype, sex, age, and time of day. The degree of the total sleep error was dependent on genotype during the daytime (P $\backslash$textless 0.001) and was dependent on age during both the daytime and the nighttime (P $\backslash$textless 0.001 for both). The DAMS method overestimated sleep bout duration during both the day and night, and the degree of these errors was genotype dependent (P $\backslash$textless 0.001). Brief movements that occur during sleep bouts can be accurately identified using video. Both video and DAMS detected a homeostatic response to sleep deprivation. Conclusions: Video digital analysis is more accurate than DAMS in fly sleep measurements. In particular, conclusions drawn from DAMS measurements regarding daytime sleep and sleep architecture should be made with caution. Video analysis also permits the assessment of fly position and brief movements during sleep. Citation: Zimmerman JE; Raizen DM; Maycock MH; Maislin G; Pack AI.

In this work, we demonstrate a novel link between gustatory perception of sugar and sleep patterning in D. melanogaster . The presence of low dietary sugar reduced the arousal threshold for waking, leading to repartitioning of sleep into a larger number of episodes throughout the day. Gustatory perception was both required and sufficient for this effect. Further addition of sugar to the dietary environment suppressed the effects of gustatory perception through a gustatory-independent mechanism. Although the quantity of dietary sugar also regulated fat accumulation, gustatory perception was not required, indicating that diet-induced changes in obesity and sleep behavior may be mechanistically separable. These findings illustrate a mechanism for the regulation of behavioral state by the availability of dietary nutrients through the interplay between gustatory and non-gustatory factors.},

  abstract = {Sleep is conserved across phyla and can be measured through electrophysiological or behavioral characteristics. The fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, provides an excellent model for investigating the genetic and neural mechanisms that regulate sleep. Multiple systems exist for measuring fly activity, including video analysis and single-beam (SB) or multi-beam (MB) infrared (IR)-based monitoring. In this study, we compare multiple sleep parameters of individual flies using a custom-built video-based acquisition system, and commercially available SB- or MB-IR acquisition systems. We report that all three monitoring systems appear sufficiently sensitive to detect changes in sleep duration associated with diet, age, and mating status. Our data also demonstrate that MB-IR detection appeared more sensitive than the SB-IR for detecting baseline nuances in sleep architecture, while architectural changes associated with varying life-history and environment were generally detected across all acquisition types. Finally, video recording of flies in an arena allowed us to measure the effect of ambient environment on sleep. These experiments demonstrate a robust effect of arena shape and size as well as light levels on sleep duration and architecture, and highlighting the versatility of tracking-based sleep acquisition. These findings provide insight into the context-specific basis for choosing between Drosophila sleep acquisition systems, describe a novel cost-effective system for video tracking, and characterize sleep analysis using the MB-IR sleep analysis. Further, we describe a modified dark-place preference sleep assay using video tracking, confirming that flies prefer to sleep in dark locations.},

  abstract = {We have characterized a light-input pathway regulating Drosophila clock neuron excitability. The molecular clock drives rhythmic electrical excitability of clock neurons, and we show that the recently discovered light-input factor Quasimodo (Qsm) regulates this variation, presumably via an Na+, K+, Cl- cotransporter (NKCC) and the Shaw K+ channel (dKV3.1). Because of light-dependent degradation of the clock protein Timeless (Tim), constant illumination (LL) leads to a breakdown of molecular and behavioral rhythms. Both overexpression (OX) and knockdown (RNAi) of qsm, NKCC, or Shaw led to robust LL rhythmicity. Whole-cell recordings of the large ventral lateral neurons (l-LNv) showed that altering Qsm levels reduced the daily variation in neuronal activity: qsmOX led to a constitutive less active, night-like state, and qsmRNAi led to a more active, day-like state. Qsm also affected daily changes in K+ currents and the GABA reversal potential, suggesting a role in modifying membrane currents and GABA responses in a daily fashion, potentially modulating light arousal and input to the clock. When directly challenged with blue light, wild-type l-LNvs responded with increased firing at night and no net response during the day, whereas altering Qsm, NKKC, or Shaw levels abolished these day/night differences. Finally, coexpression of ShawOX and NKCCRNAi in a qsm mutant background restored LL-induced behavioral arrhythmicity and wild-type neuronal activity patterns, suggesting that the three genes operate in the same pathway. We propose that Qsm affects both daily and acute light effects in l-LNvs probably acting on Shaw and NKCC.},

Studies in Drosophila have revealed molecular pathways and neural tissues regulating sleep; however, genes that maintain genetic variation for sleep in natural populations are unknown. Here, we characterized sleep in 40 wild-derived Drosophila lines and observed abundant genetic variation in sleep architecture. We associated sleep with genome-wide variation in gene expression to identify candidate genes. We independently confirmed that molecular polymorphisms in Catsup (Catecholamines up) are associated with variation in sleep and that P-element mutations in four candidate genes affect sleep and gene expression. Transcripts associated with sleep grouped into biologically plausible genetically correlated transcriptional modules. We confirmed co-regulated gene expression using P-element mutants. Quantitative genetic analysis of natural phenotypic variation is an efficient method for revealing candidate genes and pathways.},

Here we show, using optogenetic manipulation and video recording, that a subset of dorsal clock neurons (DN1s) are potent sleep-promoting cells that release glutamate to directly inhibit key pacemaker neurons. The pacemakers promote morning arousal by activating these DN1s, implying that a late-day feedback circuit drives midday siesta and night-time sleep. To investigate more plastic aspects of the sleep program, we used a calcium assay to monitor and compare the real-time activity of DN1 neurons in freely behaving males and females. Our results revealed that DN1 neurons were more active in males than in females, consistent with the finding that male flies sleep more during the day. DN1 activity is also enhanced by elevated temperature, consistent with the ability of higher temperatures to increase sleep. These new approaches indicate that DN1s have a major effect on the fly sleep-wake profile and integrate environmental information with the circadian molecular program.},

Geneswitch was activated by feeding the steroid RU486, to the flies. We used an aversive classical conditioning paradigm to quantify memory and measures of activity to infer sleep. Immune stimulated flies exhibited reduced levels of sleep, which could not be explained by a generalised increase in waking activity. Immune stimulated flies also showed a reduction in memory abilities. These results lend support to Drosophila as a model for immune-neural interactions and provide a possible role for sleep in the interplay between the immune response and memory.},

  abstract = {Extended periods of waking result in physiological impairments in humans, rats, and flies. Sleep homeostasis, the increase in sleep observed following sleep loss, is believed to counter the negative effects of prolonged waking by restoring vital biological processes that are degraded during sleep deprivation. Sleep homeostasis, as with other behaviors, is influenced by both genes and environment. We report here that during periods of starvation, flies remain spontaneously awake but, in contrast to sleep deprivation, do not accrue any of the negative consequences of prolonged waking. Specifically, the homeostatic response and learning impairments that are a characteristic of sleep loss are not observed following prolonged waking induced by starvation. Recently, two genes, brummer (bmm) and Lipid storage droplet 2 (Lsd2), have been shown to modulate the response to starvation. bmm mutants have excess fat and are resistant to starvation, whereas Lsd2 mutants are lean and sensitive to starvation. Thus, we hypothesized that bmm and Lsd2 may play a role in sleep regulation. Indeed, bmm mutant flies display a large homeostatic response following sleep deprivation. In contrast, Lsd2 mutant flies, which phenocopy aspects of starvation as measured by low triglyceride stores, do not exhibit a homeostatic response following sleep loss. Importantly, Lsd2 mutant flies are not learning impaired after sleep deprivation. These results provide the first genetic evidence, to our knowledge, that lipid metabolism plays an important role in regulating the homeostatic response and can protect against neuronal impairments induced by prolonged waking.},

In Drosophila, clock proteins are expressed in many metabolically important tissues but have not been linked to metabolic processes. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila feeding behavior displays a 24 hr circadian rhythm that is regulated by clocks in digestive/metabolic tissues. Flies lacking clocks in these tissues, in particular in the fat body, also display increased food consumption but have decreased levels of glycogen and a higher sensitivity to starvation. Interestingly, glycogen levels and starvation sensitivity are also affected by clocks in neuronal cells, but the effects of neuronal clocks generally oppose those of the fat body. We propose that the input of neuronal clocks and clocks in metabolic tissues is coordinated to provide effective energy homeostasis. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In order to analyse the role of the anterior hypothalamus in the regulation of the sleep-waking cycle we made bilateral neuronal lesions at different levels of the anterior hypothalamus in cats, by means of microinjections of a cell-specific neurotoxin: ibotenic acid. These lesions resulted in severe insomnia in eight cats. This insomnia was characterized by a large decrease or even disappearance of paradoxical sleep and deep slow wave sleep and, to a lesser extent, by a decrease of light slow wave sleep, for 2-3 weeks. In the other five animals, we observed a large reduction of deep slow wave sleep (0-40\% of control level), but a less intensive decrease of time spent in paradoxical sleep (50-75\% of control level) and no marked effect on light slow wave sleep. During the first 3-6 postoperative days we also noticed hyperthermia in all cats; thereafter, the animals presented only a slight increase in brain temperature which did not appear to trigger the sleep impairment. Histological analysis of the different lesions revealed that the insomnia could be attributed to neuronal cell body destruction in the mediobasal part of the anterior hypothalamus covering: the medial preoptic area and a narrow portion of the lateral preoptic area as well as a restricted part of the anterior hypothalamic nucleus. In order to investigate the putative role of the posterior hypothalamic structures in the mechanism of insomnia after lesion of the mediobasal preoptic area neurons we injected an agonist of GABA into the ventrolateral part of the posterior hypothalamus to locally depress the neuronal activity. The bilateral intracerebral microinjection of muscimol (0.5-5 $\mu$g) induced a transient intensive hypersomnia (slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep). These findings indicate that neuronal cell loss in the mediobasal preoptic area induced a long lasting insomnia. Thus, it may be hypothesized that the integrity of this structure is necessary for sleep appearance. Finally, our data are in keeping with an intrahypothalamic regulation of the sleep-waking cycle. \textcopyright{} 1989.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sleep is a highly conserved behavior, yet its duration and pattern vary extensively among species and between individuals within species. The genetic basis of natural variation in sleep remains unknown. RESULTS: We used the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) to perform a genome-wide association (GWA) study of sleep in D. melanogaster. We identified candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with differences in the mean as well as the environmental sensitivity of sleep traits; these SNPs typically had sex-specific or sex-biased effects, and were generally located in non-coding regions. The majority of SNPs (80.3\%) affecting sleep were at low frequency and had moderately large effects. Additive models incorporating multiple SNPs explained as much as 55\% of the genetic variance for sleep in males and females. Many of these loci are known to interact physically and/or genetically, enabling us to place them in candidate genetic networks. We confirmed the role of seven novel loci on sleep using insertional mutagenesis and RNA interference. CONCLUSIONS: We identified many SNPs in novel loci that are potentially associated with natural variation in sleep, as well as SNPs within genes previously known to affect Drosophila sleep. Several of the candidate genes have human homologues that were identified in studies of human sleep, suggesting that genes affecting variation in sleep are conserved across species. Our discovery of genetic variants that influence environmental sensitivity to sleep may have a wider application to all GWA studies, because individuals with highly plastic genotypes will not have consistent phenotypes.},

Sleep was also determined for 6 laboratory strains of Canton-S and 3 inbred lines. The variance of total sleep was determined for all groups and conditions. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The circadian periods and the effects of age upon sleep were the same between w(1118ex) and w(CS10) strains. However, the w(1118ex) and w(CS10) strains demonstrated genotype-dependent differences in the effects upon sleep of sex, mating status, social experience, and being on different foods. Variance of total sleep was found to differ in a genotype dependent manner for interventions between the w(1118ex) and w(CS10) strains. Six different laboratory Canton-S strains were found to have significantly different circadian periods (P $\backslash$textless 0.001) and sleep phenotypes (P $\backslash$textless 0.001). Three inbred lines showed reduced variance for sleep measurements. CONCLUSIONS One must control environmental conditions in a rigorously consistent manner to ensure that sleep data may be compared between experiments.

  abstract = {Animals from flies to humans are able to distinguish subtle gradations in temperature and show strong temperature preferences. Animals move to environments of optimal temperature and some manipulate the temperature of their surroundings, as humans do using clothing and shelter. Despite the ubiquitous influence of environmental temperature on animal behaviour, the neural circuits and strategies through which animals select a preferred temperature remain largely unknown. Here we identify a small set of warmth-activated anterior cell (AC) neurons located in the Drosophila brain, the function of which is critical for preferred temperature selection. AC neuron activation occurs just above the fly's preferred temperature and depends on dTrpA1, an ion channel that functions as a molecular sensor of warmth. Flies that selectively express dTrpA1 in the AC neurons select normal temperatures, whereas flies in which dTrpA1 function is reduced or eliminated choose warmer temperatures. This internal warmth-sensing pathway promotes avoidance of slightly elevated temperatures and acts together with a distinct pathway for cold avoidance to set the fly's preferred temperature. Thus, flies select a preferred temperature by using a thermal sensing pathway tuned to trigger avoidance of temperatures that deviate even slightly from the preferred temperature. This provides a potentially general strategy for robustly selecting a narrow temperature range optimal for survival.},

  doi = {10.1038/nature19055},
  abstract = {Sleep disconnects animals from the external world, at considerable risks and costs that must be offset by a vital benefit. Insight into this mysterious benefit will come from understanding sleep homeostasis: to monitor sleep need, an internal bookkeeper must track physiological changes that are linked to the core function of sleep. In Drosophila, a crucial component of the machinery for sleep homeostasis is a cluster of neurons innervating the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) of the central complex. Artificial activation of these cells induces sleep, whereas reductions in excitability cause insomnia. dFB neurons in sleep-deprived flies tend to be electrically active, with high input resistances and long membrane time constants, while neurons in rested flies tend to be electrically silent. Correlative evidence thus supports the simple view that homeostatic sleep control works by switching sleep-promoting neurons between active and quiescent states. Here we demonstrate state switching by dFB neurons, identify dopamine as a neuromodulator that operates the switch, and delineate the switching mechanism. Arousing dopamine caused transient hyperpolarization of dFB neurons within tens of milliseconds and lasting excitability suppression within minutes. Both effects were transduced by Dop1R2 receptors and mediated by potassium conductances. The switch to electrical silence involved the downregulation of voltage-gated A-type currents carried by Shaker and Shab, and the upregulation of voltage-independent leak currents through a two-pore-domain potassium channel that we term Sandman. Sandman is encoded by the CG8713 gene and translocates to the plasma membrane in response to dopamine. dFB-restricted interference with the expression of Shaker or Sandman decreased or increased sleep, respectively, by slowing the repetitive discharge of dFB neurons in the ON state or blocking their entry into the OFF state. Biophysical changes in a small population of neurons are thus linked to the control of sleep-wake state.},

  abstract = {Sleep is essential for the maintenance of the brain and the body, yet many features of sleep are poorly understood and mathematical models are an important tool for probing proposed biological mechanisms. The most well-known mathematical model of sleep regulation, the two-process model, models the sleep-wake cycle by two oscillators: a circadian oscillator and a homeostatic oscillator. An alternative, more recent, model considers the mutual inhibition of sleep promoting neurons and the ascending arousal system regulated by homeostatic and circadian processes. Here we show there are fundamental similarities between these two models. The implications are illustrated with two important sleep-wake phenomena. Firstly, we show that in the two-process model, transitions between different numbers of daily sleep episodes occur at grazing bifurcations.This provides the theoretical underpinning for numerical results showing that the sleep patterns of many mammals can be explained by the mutual inhibition model. Secondly, we show that when sleep deprivation disrupts the sleep-wake cycle, ostensibly different measures of sleepiness in the two models are closely related. The demonstration of the mathematical similarities of the two models is valuable because not only does it allow some features of the two-process model to be interpreted physiologically but it also means that knowledge gained from study of the two-process model can be used to inform understanding of the mutual inhibition model. This is important because the mutual inhibition model and its extensions are increasingly being used as a tool to understand a diverse range of sleep-wake phenomena such as the design of optimal shift-patterns, yet the values it uses for parameters associated with the circadian and homeostatic processes are very different from those that have been experimentally measured in the context of the two-process model.},

Technologies that enable temporally precise control of electrical activity of specific neurons, and not these neurons' neighbors-whose cell bodies or processes might be just tens to hundreds of nanometers away-must involve two components. First, they require as a trigger a transient pulse of energy that supports the temporal precision of the control. Second, they require a molecular sensitizer that can be expressed in specific neurons and which renders those neurons specifically responsive to the triggering energy delivered. Optogenetic tools, such as microbial opsins, can be used to activate or silence neural activity with brief pulses of light. Thermogenetic tools, such as thermosensitive TRP channels, can be used to drive neural activity downstream of increases or decreases in temperature. We here discuss the principles underlying the operation of these two recently developed, but widely used, toolboxes, as well as the directions being taken in the use and improvement of these toolboxes.},

  abstract = {Background: Extended wakefulness disrupts acquisition of short-term memories in mammals. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by extended waking and restored by sleep are unknown. Moreover, the neuronal circuits that depend on sleep for optimal learning remain unidentified. Results: Learning was evaluated with aversive phototaxic suppression. In this task, flies learn to avoid light that is paired with an aversive stimulus (quinine-humidity). We demonstrate extensive homology in sleep-deprivation-induced learning impairment between flies and humans. Both 6 hr and 12 hr of sleep deprivation are sufficient to impair learning in Canton-S (Cs) flies. Moreover, learning is impaired at the end of the normal waking day in direct correlation with time spent awake. Mechanistic studies indicate that this task requires intact mushroom bodies (MBs) and requires the dopamine D1-like receptor (dDA1). Importantly, sleep-deprivation-induced learning impairments could be rescued by targeted gene expression of the dDA1 receptor to the MBs. Conclusions: These data provide direct evidence that extended wakefulness disrupts learning in Drosophila. These results demonstrate that it is possible to prevent the effects of sleep deprivation by targeting a single neuronal structure and identify cellular and molecular targets adversely affected by extended waking in a genetically tractable model organism. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we identify a Drosophila mutant, wide awake (wake), that exhibits a marked delay in sleep onset at dusk. Loss of WAKE in a set of arousal-promoting clock neurons, the large ventrolateral neurons (l-LNvs), impairs sleep onset. WAKE levels cycle, peaking near dusk, and the expression of WAKE in l-LNvs is Clock dependent. Strikingly, Clock and cycle mutants also exhibit a profound delay in sleep onset, which can be rescued by restoring WAKE expression in LNvs. WAKE interacts with the GABAA receptor Resistant to Dieldrin (RDL), upregulating its levels and promoting its localization to the plasma membrane. In wake mutant l-LNvs, GABA sensitivity is decreased and excitability is increased at dusk. We propose that WAKE acts as a clock output molecule specifically for sleep, inhibiting LNvs at dusk to promote the transition from wake to sleep. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Recent human studies suggest that genetic polymorphisms allow an individual to maintain optimal cognitive functioning during sleep deprivation. If such polymorphisms were not associated with additional costs, selective pressures would allow these alleles to spread through the population such that an evolutionary alternative to sleep would emerge. To determine whether there are indeed costs associated with resiliency to sleep loss, we challenged natural allelic variants of the foraging gene (for) with either sleep deprivation or starvation. Flies with high levels of Protein Kinase G (PKG) (forR) do not display deficits in short-term memory following 12 h of sleep deprivation. However, short-term memory is significantly disrupted when forR flies are starved overnight. In contrast, flies with low levels of PKG (fors, fors2) show substantial deficits in short-term memory following sleep deprivation but retain their ability to learn after 12 h of starvation. We found that forR phenotypes could be largely recapitulated in fors flies by selectively increasing the level of PKG in the $\alpha$/$\beta$ lobes of the mushroom bodies, a structure known to regulate both sleep and memory. Together, these data indicate that whereas the expression of for may appear to provide resilience in one environmental context, it may confer an unexpected vulnerability in other situations. Understanding how these tradeoffs confer resilience or vulnerability to specific environmental challenges may provide additional clues as to why an evolutionary alternative to sleep has not emerged.},

We identify here a circuit that underlies the wake-promoting effects of octopamine in Drosophila. Using MARCM, we identified the ASM cells in the medial protocerebrum as the wake-promoting octopaminergic cells. We then blocked octopamine signaling in random areas of the fly brain and mapped the postsynaptic effect to insulin-secreting neurons of the pars intercerebralis (PI). These PI neurons show altered potassium channel function as well as an increase in cAMP in response to octopamine, and genetic manipulation of their electrical excitability alters sleep:wake behavior. Effects of octopamine on sleep:wake are mediated by the cAMP-dependent isoform of the OAMB receptor. These studies define the cellular and molecular basis of octopamine action and suggest that the PI is a sleep:wake-regulating neuroendocrine structure like the mammalian hypothalamus.

The disk-over-water method permits chronic sleep deprivation of rats with gentle physical stimulation that can be equally applied to yoked control rats. A series of studies with this method has revealed little or no pathology in the control rats. The deprived rats show a reliable syndrome that includes temperature changes (which vary with the sleep stages that are lost); heat seeking behavior; increased food intake; weight loss; increased metabolic rate; increased plasma norepinephrine; decreased plasma thyroxine; an increased triiodothyronine-thyroxine ratio; and an increase of an enzyme which mediates thermogenesis by brown adipose tissue. The temperature changes are attributable to excessive heat loss and an elevated thermoregulatory setpoint, both of which increase thermoregulatory load, and the other changes are interpretable as responses to this increased load. This pattern indicates that sleep serves a thermoregulatory function in the rat. The sleep deprived rats also show stereotypic ulcerative and hyperkeratotic lesions localized to the tail and plantar surfaces of the paws, and they die within a matter of weeks; the mediation of these changes is unresolved. ?? 1995.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The neuronal circuitry underlying sleep is poorly understood. Although dopamine (DA) is thought to play a key role in sleep/wake regulation, the identities of the individual DA neurons and their downstream targets required for this process are unknown. RESULTS: Here, we identify a DA neuron in each PPL1 cluster that promotes wakefulness in Drosophila. Imaging data suggest that the activity of these neurons is increased during wakefulness, consistent with a role in promoting arousal. Strikingly, these neurons project to the dorsal fan-shaped body, which has previously been shown to promote sleep. The reduced sleep caused by activation of DA neurons can be blocked by loss of DopR, and restoration of DopR expression in the fan-shaped body can rescue the wake-promoting effects of DA in a DopR mutant background. CONCLUSIONS: These experiments define a novel arousal circuit at the single-cell level. Because the dorsal fan-shaped body promotes sleep, these data provide a key link between wake and sleep circuits. Furthermore, these findings suggest that inhibition of sleep centers via monoaminergic signaling is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to promote arousal.},

A richer wake experience resulted in both larger synaptic growth and greater sleep need. Finally, we demonstrate that the gene Fmr1 (fragile X mental retardation 1) plays an important role in sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization.},

Drosophila sleep has been studied extensively, with the aim of gaining fundamental insights into the evolutionarily conserved functions of sleep as well as the mechanisms that regulate it. An interesting question that has not yet been addressed is whether fly sleep can be classified into distinct sleep types, each having particular biological roles - like rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep in birds and mammals. Typically, Drosophila sleep displays a bimodal pattern, consisting of distinct daytime and nighttime components. Notably, daytime and nighttime sleep differ with respect to several qualities, such as sleep-bout lengths and arousal thresholds. In this short review, we describe several genetic and environmental factors that differentially affect daytime and nighttime sleep, highlighting the observations suggesting the notion that these temporally distinct components of Drosophila sleep may have unique biological functions and be regulated by different homeostatic regulatory mechanisms.},

Determining which genes underlie this phenotype could shed light on the mechanisms and functions of sleep. To do so, we performed mutagenesis in Drosophila melanogaster, because flies also sleep for many hours and, when sleep deprived, show sleep rebound and performance impairments. By screening 9,000 mutant lines, we found minisleep (mns), a line that sleeps for one-third of the wild-type amount. We show that mns flies perform normally in a number of tasks, have preserved sleep homeostasis, but are not impaired by sleep deprivation. We then show that mns flies carry a point mutation in a conserved domain of the Shaker gene. Moreover, after crossing out genetic modifiers accumulated over many generations, other Shaker alleles also become short sleepers and fail to complement the mns phenotype. Finally, we show that short-sleeping Shaker flies have a reduced lifespan. Shaker, which encodes a voltage-dependent potassium channel controlling membrane repolarization and transmitter release, may thus regulate sleep need or efficiency.},

Here, we report that sleep-promoting neurons with projections to the dorsal fan-shaped body (FB) form the output arm of Drosophila's sleep homeostat. Homeostatic sleep control requires the Rho-GTPase-activating protein encoded by the crossveinless-c (cv-c) gene in order to transduce sleep pressure into increased electrical excitability of dorsal FB neurons. cv-c mutants exhibit decreased sleep time, diminished sleep rebound, and memory deficits comparable to those after sleep loss. Targeted ablation and rescue of Cv-c in sleep-control neurons of the dorsal FB impair and restore, respectively, normal sleep patterns. Sleep deprivation increases the excitability of dorsal FB neurons, but this homeostatic adjustment is disrupted in short-sleeping cv-c mutants. Sleep pressure thus shifts the input-output function of sleep-promoting neurons toward heightened activity by modulating ion channel function in a mechanism dependent on Cv-c. ?? 2014 The Authors.},

The protein encoded by insomniac is a member of the BTB/POZ superfamily, which includes many proteins that function as adaptors for the Cullin-3 (Cul3) ubiquitin ligase complex. We show that Insomniac can physically associate with Cul3, and that reduction of Cul3 activity in neurons recapitulates the insomniac phenotype.

Sleep in fruit flies shares many features with mammalian sleep, but it is currently unknown to what extent behavioral states affect gene expression in Drosophila. To find out, we performed a comprehensive microarray analysis of gene expression in spontaneously awake, sleep-deprived and sleeping flies. Fly heads were collected at 4 am, after 8 h of spontaneous sleep or sleep deprivation, and at 4 pm, after 8 h of spontaneous wakefulness. As in rats, we found that behavioral state and time of day affect Drosophila gene expression to a comparable extent. As in rats, transcripts with higher expression in wakefulness and in sleep belong to different functional categories, and in several cases these groups overlap with those previously identified in rats. Wakefulness-related genes code for transcription factors and for proteins involved in the stress response, immune response, glutamatergic transmission, and carbohydrate metabolism. Sleep-related transcripts include the glial gene anachronism and several genes involved in lipid metabolism. Finally, the expression of many wakefulness-related and sleep-related Drosophila transcripts is also modulated by the time of day, suggesting an interaction at the molecular level between circadian and homeostatic mechanism of sleep regulation.},

This clock relies on several groups of neurons that express the Period (PER) protein, including the ventral lateral neurons (LN(v)s), which express the Pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptide, and the PDF-negative dorsal lateral neurons (LN(d)s). In normal cycles of day and night, adult flies exhibit morning and evening peaks of activity; however, the contribution of the different clock neurons to the rest-activity pattern remains unknown. Here, we have used targeted expression of PER to restore the clock function of specific subsets of lateral neurons in arrhythmic per(0) mutant flies. We show that PER expression restricted to the LN(v)s only restores the morning activity, whereas expression of PER in both the LN(v)s and LN(d)s also restores the evening activity. This provides the first neuronal bases for 'morning' and 'evening' oscillators in the Drosophila brain. Furthermore, we show that the LN(v)s alone can generate 24 h activity rhythms in constant darkness, indicating that the morning oscillator is sufficient to drive the circadian system.},

Recently also sleep homeostasis has been included, because it is now well established that mammalian species can compensate for sleep loss both by an increase in sleep duration as well as by intensifying non-REM sleep. The occurrence of EEG slow-wave activity has served as a measure for sleep intensity. The capacity to sleep more intensely enables animals to react more flexibly to sleep loss.

Flies subjected to late DEP experienced enhanced sleep following the deprivation period, and showed a modest improvement in survival outcome. Continuous DEP (early and late DEP) throughout infection also enhanced sleep later during infection and improved survival. However, improved survival in flies subjected to late or continuous DEP did not occur until after flies had experienced sleep. During infection, both early and late DEP enhanced NF$\kappa$B transcriptional activity as measured by a luciferase reporter ($\kappa$B-luc) in living flies. Early DEP also increased NF$\kappa$B activity prior to infection. Flies that were deficient in expression of either the Relish or Dif NF$\kappa$B transcription factors showed normal responses to early DEP.

  abstract = {The energy allocation (EA) model defines behavioral strategies that optimize the temporal utilization of energy to maximize reproductive success. This model proposes that all species of the animal kingdom share a universal sleep function that shunts waking energy utilization toward sleep-dependent biological investment. For endotherms, REM sleep evolved to enhance energy appropriation for somatic and CNS-related processes by eliminating thermoregulatory defenses and skeletal muscle tone. Alternating REM with NREM sleep conserves energy by decreasing the need for core body temperature defense. Three EA phenotypes are proposed: sleep-wake cycling, torpor, and continuous (or predominant) wakefulness. Each phenotype carries inherent costs and benefits. Sleep-wake cycling downregulates specific biological processes in waking and upregulates them in sleep, thereby decreasing energy demands imposed by wakefulness, reducing cellular infrastructure requirements, and resulting in overall energy conservation. Torpor achieves the greatest energy savings, but critical biological operations are compromised. Continuous wakefulness maximizes niche exploitation, but endures the greatest energy demands. The EA model advances a new construct for understanding sleep-wake organization in ontogenetic and phylogenetic domains. \textcopyright{} 2014 The Authors.},

The drug carbamazepine (CBZ) has the opposite effect on sleep; it increases sleep latency as well as decreasing sleep. Behavioral and physiological experiments indicated that Rdl(A302S) mutant flies are resistant to the effects of CBZ on sleep latency and that mutant RDL(A302S) channels are resistant to the effects of CBZ on desensitization, respectively. These results suggest that this biophysical property of the channel, specifically channel desensitization, underlies the regulation of sleep latency in flies. These experiments uncouple the regulation of sleep latency from that of sleep duration and suggest that the kinetics of GABA(A) receptor signaling dictate sleep latency.},

  abstract = {Background: Arousal levels in the brain set thresholds for behavior, from simple to complex. The mechanistic underpinnings of the various phenomena comprising arousal, however, are still poorly understood. Drosophila behaviors have been studied that span different levels of arousal, from sleep to visual perception to psychostimulant responses. Results: We have investigated neurobiological mechanisms of arousal in the Drosophila brain by a combined behavioral, genetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approach. Administration of methamphetamine (METH) suppresses sleep and promotes active wakefulness, whereas an inhibitor of dopamine synthesis promotes sleep. METH affects courtship behavior by increasing sexual arousal while decreasing successful sexual performance. Electrophysiological recordings from the medial protocerebrum of wild-type flies showed that METH ingestion has rapid and detrimental effects on a brain response associated with perception of visual stimuli. Recordings in genetically manipulated animals show that dopaminergic transmission is required for these responses and that visual-processing deficits caused by attenuated dopaminergic transmission can be rescued by METH. Conclusions: We show that changes in dopamine levels differentially affect arousal for behaviors of varying complexity. Complex behaviors, such as visual perception, degenerate when dopamine levels are either too high or too low, in accordance with the inverted-U hypothesis of dopamine action in the mammalian brain. Simpler behaviors, such as sleep and locomotion, show graded responses that follow changes in dopamine level. ??2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Here, we report the phenotypic characterization of a Drosophila rest/activity mutant known as fumin (fmn). We show that fmn mutants have abnormally high levels of activity and reduced rest (sleep); genetic mapping, molecular analyses, and phenotypic rescue experiments demonstrate that these phenotypes result from mutation of the Drosophila dopamine transporter gene. Consistent with the rest phenotype, fmn mutants show enhanced sensitivity to mechanical stimuli and a prolonged arousal once active, indicating a decreased arousal threshold.

We found that Bremer's interest in sleep resulted from his unexpected observations after transecting the brain at the midcollicular level in the "enc\'ephale isol\'e" preparation. The sleep-like behaviour of the animal, accompanied by slow waves in the cortex, convinced him that sleep resulted from cortical deafferentation. He was further convinced that deafferentation was the cause of sleep when he found that transecting the brain at the medullary level did not much affect the sleep-wake cycle. As we show, Bremer's views that sleep is a passive phenomenon imposed on the brain because of deafferentation was shared by most of his contemporaries. Years later Bremer admitted that he interpreted his experimental findings wrongly. He continued to investigate sleep using his preparations and made important contributions to understanding the relationships between the brainstem reticular formation and the basal forebrain hypnogenic centres, as well as the importance of light on these relationships.},

The ubiquitous expression of APP:BACE or human tau disrupted sleep. The sleep deficits could be reversed and sleep could be enhanced when flies were administered the GABA-A agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-[5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP). Expressing APP:BACE disrupted both Short-term memory (STM) and Long-term memory (LTM) as assessed using Aversive Phototaxic Suppression (APS) and courtship conditioning. Flies expressing APP:BACE also showed reduced levels of the synaptic protein discs large (DLG). Enhancing sleep in memory-impaired APP:BACE flies fully restored both STM and LTM and restored DLG levels. Sleep also restored STM to flies expressing human tau. Using live-brain imaging of individual clock neurons expressing both tau and the cAMP sensor Epac1-camps, we found that tau disrupted cAMP signaling. Importantly, enhancing sleep in flies expressing human tau restored proper cAMP signaling. Thus, we demonstrate that sleep can be used as a therapeutic to reverse deficits that accrue during the expression of toxic peptides associated with Alzheimer's disease.},

Our RNAi transgenes consist of short gene fragments cloned as inverted repeats and expressed using the binary GAL4/UAS system. We generated 22,270 transgenic lines, covering 88\% of the predicted protein-coding genes in the Drosophila genome. Molecular and phenotypic assays indicate that the majority of these transgenes are functional.

According to the hypothesis, plastic processes occurring during wakefulness result in a net increase in synaptic strength in many brain circuits. The role of sleep is to downscale synaptic strength to a baseline level that is energetically sustainable, makes efficient use of gray matter space, and is beneficial for learning and memory. Thus, sleep is the price we have to pay for plasticity, and its goal is the homeostatic regulation of the total synaptic weight impinging on neurons. The hypothesis accounts for a large number of experimental facts, makes several specific predictions, and has implications for both sleep and mood disorders.},

  abstract = {The temporal pattern of locomotor activity of single Drosophila melanogaster flies freely walking in small tubes is described. Locomotor activity monitored by a light gate has a characteristic time-course that depends upon age and the environmental conditions. Several methods are applied to assess the complexity of the temporal pattern. The pattern varies according to sex, genotype, age and environmental conditions (food; light). Activity occurs clustered in bouts. The intrinsic bout structure is quantified by four parameters: number of light gate passages (counts) per bout, duration of a bout, pause between two successive bouts and mean bout period. In addition, the distribution of the periods between light-gate crossings (inter-count intervals) as function of inter-count interval duration reveals a power law, suggesting that the overall distribution of episodes of activity and inactivity has a fractal structure. In the dark without food, the fractal dimension which represents a measure of the complexity of the pattern is sex, genotype and age specific. Fractality is abolished by additional sensory stimulation (food; light). We propose that time-course, bout structure and fractal dimension of the temporal pattern of locomotor activity describe different aspects of the fly's central pattern generator for locomotion and its motivational control.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine whether the great pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis, expresses a sleep-like behavioural state. We found that snails spontaneously enter a relatively brief (22$\pm$1 min) quiescent state characterized by postural relaxation of the foot, mantle and tentacles, and cessation of radula rasping. Quiescence was reversed (`aroused') by appetitive (sucrose solution) and aversive (tactile) stimuli. Responsiveness to both stimuli was significantly lower in quiescent snails than in active snails. However, tactile stimuli evoked a more sustained defensive response in quiescent snails. Quiescence bouts were consolidated into `clusters' over an infradian timescale and were only weakly affected by time of day. Clusters contained 7$\pm$0.5 bouts, lasted 13$\pm$1 h and were separated by long (37$\pm$4 h) intervals of almost continuous activity. Analysis of Kaplan\textendash{}Meier survival curves revealed that the quiescent bout duration was described by an exponential probability distribution (time constant 15$\pm$1 min). Active bout duration was described by a bi-exponential probability distribution (time constants 62$\pm$4 and 592$\pm$48 min). We found no evidence for a `sleep rebound' mechanism and quiescence expression appeared to be regulated through stochastic processes causing state transitions to resemble a Markovian random walk. We conclude that Lymnaea is a potentially valuable model system for studies of cellular function in sleep.},

We show that, in rat cortex and hippocampus, GluR1-containing AMPA receptor (AMPAR) levels are high during wakefulness and low during sleep, and changes in the phosphorylation states of AMPARs, CamKII and GSK3beta are consistent with synaptic potentiation during wakefulness and depression during sleep. Furthermore, slope and amplitude of cortical evoked responses increase after wakefulness, decrease after sleep and correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep pressure. Changes in molecular and electrophysiological indicators of synaptic strength are largely independent of the time of day. Finally, cortical long-term potentiation can be easily induced after sleep, but not after wakefulness. Thus, wakefulness appears to be associated with net synaptic potentiation, whereas sleep may favor global synaptic depression, thereby preserving an overall balance of synaptic strength.},

Here we address this issue by exploiting the genetic tractability of the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster, which exhibits the hallmarks of vertebrate sleep. We show that large changes in sleep are achieved by spatial and temporal enhancement of cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activity specifically in the adult mushroom bodies of Drosophila. Other manipulations of the mushroom bodies, such as electrical silencing, increasing excitation or ablation, also alter sleep.

  abstract = {Sleep is homeostatically regulated, such that sleep drive reflects the duration of prior wakefulness. However, despite the discovery of genes important for sleep, a coherent molecular model for sleep homeostasis has yet to emerge. To better understand the function and regulation of sleep, we employed a reverse-genetics approach in Drosophila. An insertion in the BTB domain protein CG32810/insomniac (inc) exhibited one of the strongest baseline sleep phenotypes thus far observed, a $\sim$10 h sleep reduction. Importantly, this is coupled to a reduced homeostatic response to sleep deprivation, consistent with a disrupted sleep homeostat. Knockdown of the INC-interacting protein, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cul3, results in reduced sleep duration, consolidation, and homeostasis, suggesting an important role for protein turnover in mediating INC effects. Interestingly, inc and Cul3 expression in post-mitotic neurons during development contributes to their adult sleep functions. Similar to flies with increased dopaminergic signaling, loss of inc and Cul3 result in hyper-arousability to a mechanical stimulus in adult flies. Furthermore, the inc sleep duration phenotype can be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme for dopamine biosynthesis. Taken together, these results establish inc and Cul3 as important new players in setting the sleep homeostat and a dopaminergic arousal pathway in Drosophila.},

The Sh current is potentiated by a $\beta$ modulatory subunit coded by Hyperkinetic (Hk). Here, we demonstrate that severe loss-of-function mutations of Hk reduce sleep and do so primarily by affecting the Sh current. Moreover, we prove, using a transgenic approach, that a wild-type copy of Hk is sufficient to restore normal sleep. Furthermore, we show that short-sleeping Hk mutant lines have a memory deficit, whereas flies carrying a weaker hypomorphic Hk allele have normal sleep and normal memory. By comparing six short-sleeping Sh lines with two normal sleeping ones, we also found that only alleles that reduce sleep also impair memory. These data identify a gene, Hk, which is necessary to maintain normal sleep, and provide genetic evidence that short sleep and poor memory are linked.},

This paper discusses a hypothesis about the significance of slow-wave activity and its homeostatic regulation. The hypothesis is as follows:1. Wakefulness is associated with synaptic potentiation in several cortical circuits; 2. Synaptic potentiation is tied to the homeostatic regulation of slow-wave activity; 3. Slow-wave activity is associated with synaptic downscaling; 4. Synaptic downscaling is tied to the beneficial effects of sleep on performance.

Modafinil significantly and dose-dependently decreased rest when fed at concentrations from 2.5 mg/ml to 0.3125 mg/ml. Activity intensity was not increased, and circadian timing was unchanged, although the 2.5 mg/ml dose blunted the amplitude of overt circadian locomotor rhythms. Compared to controls, the duration of rest bouts was decreased in flies fed 2.5 mg/ml, and waking was frequently interrupted by 5-min periods of immobility. A rest rebound (significant increase in rest) followed withdrawal of either 2.5mg/ml or 0.625mg/ml modafinil after 48H. When directly compared to 6H total rest deprivation, the increase after withdrawal was briefer, reminiscent of the attenuated rest rebound seen in mammals, including humans, after modafinil. However, modafinil withdrawal combined with 6H total rest deprivation significantly enhanced the rebound, suggesting that a rest debt is accumulating during modafinil. We conclude that modafinil affects states of arousal in Drosophila in the same direction as it does in mammals. This discovery provides a tool for searching for conserved molecular mechanisms by which modafinil regulates rest and waking.},

The following original effects were confirmed in subsequent studies: 1. Mortality: Unless deprivation was halted, all TSD rats died or showed signs of impending death\textemdash{}usually in about two to three weeks. 2-10 The deaths (after about four to six weeks) of PSD rats were also confirmed. 11,12 2. TSD and PSD rats lost weight in spite of increased food intake. The large rise in energy expenditure (EE), calculated from the caloric values of food intake and weight loss) was confirmed. 2,4-9,13-17 3. The development of scrawny, debilitated appearance was con-firmed. 2,4-7,11 4. The severe ulcerative and hyperkeratotic skin lesions localized to the paws and tails of TSD and PSD rats were confirmed. 2,4-7,9,11 5. As in the original studies, TSD rats showed an initial rise and subsequent decline in waking intraperitoneal temperature (T ip). 2,4,5,10,11,14,16 As before, PSD rats showed only the T ip decline. 11,12 6. As in the earlier report, recovery from extended TSD featured large rebounds of PS. 6,16 Recent studies showed a predominance of PS rebound after only two 18 or four 19 days of TSD. Altogether, the confirmatory studies showed that TSD and PSD produce a reliably elicited syndrome of major biological effects. POSSIBLE CONFOUNDS The introduction to this series of papers 20 emphasized that sleep deprivation studies are essentially correlational. We admin-ister stimuli that produce the responses of sleep reduction and the responses of physiological or behavioral change. These are cor-related responses. We cannot confidently interpret the physio-logical and behavioral changes as effects of the sleep loss until we can discount the plausibility of other putative mediators of the physiological and behavioral change that are produced by the experimental situation. Two alternative mediators have been sug-gested: loss of circadian rhythm and stress. Circadian Rhythm Because sleep deprived rats might have weaker circadian rhythms than control rats, all our experiments had been run in constant light to flatten the circadian rhythms of both sleep deprived and control rats. However, this procedure caused at least one journal reviewer to question whether the effects we reported might have resulted from an interaction of rhythm and sleep loss (i.e., the SDEs might occur only when circadian rhythms were flat). Because we knew of no effects of circadian rhythm loss that resembled the SDEs, and because there was no appealing rationale for the suggested interaction, we doubted its plausibility. Nevertheless, to dispose of such questions, we repeated the basic TSD disk-over-water experiment under 12:12 light-dark conditions. 6 All the major SDEs that we had previ-ously reported were still present, including: increased food intake; decreased weight; increased EE; debilitated appearance; lesions on the paws and tail; an initial increase followed by a large decrease in T ip ; impending death; and recovery which fea-tured large, sustained rebounds of PS and reversal of all TSD-induced changes.

Here we show that starvation in Drosophila potently suppresses sleep, suggesting that these two homeostatically regulated behaviors are also integrated in flies. The sleep-suppressing effect of starvation is independent of the mushroom bodies, a previously identified sleep locus in the fly brain, and therefore is regulated by distinct neural circuitry. The circadian clock genes Clock (Clk) and cycle (cyc) are critical for proper sleep suppression during starvation. However, the sleep suppression is independent of light cues and of circadian rhythms as shown by the fact that starved period mutants sleep like wild-type flies. By selectively targeting subpopulations of Clk-expressing neurons, we localize the observed sleep phenotype to the dorsally located circadian neurons. These findings show that Clk and cyc act during starvation to modulate the conflict of whether flies sleep or search for food.},

Starvation has been shown to potently suppress sleep across species; however, whether satiety promotes sleep is still unclear. Here we use the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, as a model organism to address the interactions between feeding and sleep. We first monitored the sleep of flies that had been starved for 24 h and found that sleep amount increased in the first 4 h after flies were given food. Increased sleep after starvation was due to an increase in sleep bout number and average sleep bout length. Mutants of translin or adipokinetic hormone, which fail to suppress sleep during starvation, still exhibited a sleep increase after starvation, suggesting that sleep increase after starvation is not a consequence of sleep loss during starvation. We also found that feeding activity and food consumption were higher in the first 10\textendash{}30 min after starvation. Restricting food consumption in starved flies to 30 min was sufficient to increase sleep for 1 h. Although flies ingested a comparable amount of food at differing sucrose concentrations, sleep increase after starvation on a lower sucrose concentration was undetectable. Taken together, our results suggest increased food intake after starvation enhances sleep and reveals a novel relationship between feeding and sleep.},

  abstract = {The advantages of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, including low genetic redundancy, functional simplicity, and the ability to conduct large-scale genetic screens, have been essential for understanding the molecular nature of circadian ($\sim$24 hr) rhythms, and continue to be valuable in discovering novel regulators of circadian rhythms and sleep. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of these interrelated biological processes in Drosophila and the wider implications of this research. Clock genes period and timeless were first discovered in large-scale Drosophila genetic screens developed in the 1970s. Feedback of period and timeless on their own transcription forms the core of the molecular clock, and accurately timed expression, localization, post-transcriptional modification, and function of these genes is thought to be critical for maintaining the circadian cycle. Regulators, including several phosphatases and kinases, act on different steps of this feedback loop to ensure strong and accurately timed rhythms. Approximately 150 neurons in the fly brain that contain the core components of the molecular clock act together to translate this intracellular cycling into rhythmic behavior. We discuss how different groups of clock neurons serve different functions in allowing clocks to entrain to environmental cues, driving behavioral outputs at different times of day, and allowing flexible behavioral responses in different environmental conditions. The neuropeptide PDF provides an important signal thought to synchronize clock neurons, although the details of how PDF accomplishes this function are still being explored. Secreted signals from clock neurons also influence rhythms in other tissues. SLEEP is, in part, regulated by the circadian clock, which ensures appropriate timing of sleep, but the amount and quality of sleep are also determined by other mechanisms that ensure a homeostatic balance between sleep and wake. Flies have been useful for identifying a large set of genes, molecules, and neuroanatomic loci important for regulating sleep amount. Conserved aspects of sleep regulation in flies and mammals include wake-promoting roles for catecholamine neurotransmitters and involvement of hypothalamus-like regions, although other neuroanatomic regions implicated in sleep in flies have less clear parallels. Sleep is also subject to regulation by factors such as food availability, stress, and social environment. We are beginning to understand how the identified molecules and neurons interact with each other, and with the environment, to regulate sleep. Drosophila researchers can also take advantage of increasing mechanistic understanding of other behaviors, such as learning and memory, courtship, and aggression, to understand how sleep loss impacts these behaviors. Flies thus remain a valuable tool for both discovery of novel molecules and deep mechanistic understanding of sleep and circadian rhythms.},

Major findings include the discovery of a single gene underlying the sleep disorder narcolepsy, and identification of loci that make quantitative contributions to sleep characteristics. The sleep field has also expanded its focus from mammalian model organisms to Drosophila, zebrafish, and worms, which is allowing the application of novel genetic approaches. Researchers have undertaken large-scale screens to identify new genes that regulate sleep, and are also probing questions of sleep circuitry and sleep function on a molecular level. As genetic tools continue to be refined in each model organism, the genes that support a specific function in sleep will become more apparent.

  abstract = {Extended periods of rest in Drosophila melanogaster resemble mammalian sleep states in that they are characterized by heightened arousal thresholds and specific alterations in gene expression [1, 2]. Defined as inactivity periods spanning 5 or more min, amounts of this sleep-like state are, as in mammals, sensitive to prior amounts of waking activity, time of day, and pharmacological intervention [1-3]. Clearly recognizable changes in the pattern and amount of brain electrical activity accompany changes in motor activity and arousal thresholds originally used to identify mammalian sleeping behavior [4-6]. Electroencephalograms (EEGs) and/or local field potentials (LFPs) are now widely used to quantify sleep state amounts and define types of sleep. Thus, slow-wave sleep (SWS) is characterized by EEG spindles and large-amplitude delta-frequency (0-3.5 Hz) waves. Rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep is characterized by irregular gamma-frequency cortical EEG patterns and rhythmic theta-frequency (5-9 Hz) hippocampal EEG activity [7]. It is unknown whether rest and activity in Drosophila are associated with distinct electrophysiological correlates. To address this issue, we monitored motor activity levels and recorded LFPs in the medial brain between the mushroom bodies, structures implicated in the modulation of locomotor activity, of Drosophila [8]. The results indicate that LFPs can be reliably recorded from the brains of awake, moving fruit flies, that targeted genetic manipulations can be used to localize sources of LFP activity, and that brain electrical activity of Drosophila is reliably correlated with activity state.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground Although sleep is an important process essential for life, its regulation is poorly understood. The recently developed Drosophila model for sleep provides a powerful system to genetically and pharmacologically identify molecules that regulate sleep. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter known to affect many behaviors, but its role in sleep remains controversial. Results We generated or obtained flies with genetically altered expression of each of three Drosophila serotonin receptor subtypes (d5-HT1A, d5-HT1B, and d5-HT2) and assayed them for baseline sleep phenotypes. The data indicated a sleep-regulating role for the d5-HT1A receptor. d5-HT1A mutant flies had short and fragmented sleep, which was rescued by expressing the receptor in adult mushroom bodies, a structure associated with learning and memory in Drosophila. Neither the d5-HT2 receptor nor the d5-HT1B receptor, which was previously implicated in circadian regulation, had any effect on baseline sleep, indicating that serotonin affects sleep and circadian rhythms through distinct receptors. Elevating serotonin levels, either pharmacologically or genetically, enhanced sleep in wild-type flies. In addition, serotonin promoted sleep in some short-sleep mutants, suggesting that it can compensate for some sleep deficits. Conclusions These data show that serotonin promotes baseline sleep in Drosophila. They also link the regulation of sleep behavior by serotonin to a specific receptor in a distinct region of the fly brain.},

  abstract = {Summary Sleep is regulated by a circadian clock that times sleep and wake to specific times of day and a homeostat that drives sleep as a function of prior wakefulness [1]. To analyze the role of the circadian clock, we have used the fruit fly Drosophila [2]. Flies display the core behavioral features of sleep, including relative immobility, elevated arousal thresholds, and homeostatic regulation [2, 3]. We assessed sleep-wake modulation by a core set of circadian pacemaker neurons that express the neuropeptide PDF. We find that disruption of PDF function increases sleep during the late night in light:dark and the first subjective day of constant darkness. Flies deploy genetic and neurotransmitter pathways to regulate sleep that are similar to those of their mammalian counterparts, including GABA [4]. We find that RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the GABAA receptor gene, Resistant to dieldrin (Rdl), in PDF neurons reduces sleep, consistent with a role for GABA in inhibiting PDF neuron function. Patch-clamp electrophysiology reveals GABA-activated picrotoxin-sensitive chloride currents on PDF+ neurons. In addition, RDL is detectable most strongly on the large subset of PDF+ pacemaker neurons. These results suggest that GABAergic inhibition of arousal-promoting PDF neurons is an important mode of sleep-wake regulation in vivo.},

  abstract = {Sleep is a highly conserved and essential behaviour in many species, including the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In the wild, sensory signalling encoding environmental information must be integrated with sleep drive to ensure that sleep is not initiated during detrimental conditions. However, the molecular and circuit mechanisms by which sleep timing is modulated by the environment are unclear. Here we introduce a novel behavioural paradigm to study this issue. We show that in male fruit flies, onset of the daytime siesta is delayed by ambient temperatures above 29 $^\circ$C. We term this effect Prolonged Morning Wakefulness (PMW). We show that signalling through the TrpA1 thermo-sensor is required for PMW, and that TrpA1 specifically impacts siesta onset, but not night sleep onset, in response to elevated temperatures. We identify two critical TrpA1-expressing circuits and show that both contact DN1p clock neurons, the output of which is also required for PMW. Finally, we identify the circadian blue-light photoreceptor CRYPTOCHROME as a molecular regulator of PMW, and propose a model in which the Drosophila nervous system integrates information encoding temperature, light, and time to dynamically control when sleep is initiated. Our results provide a platform to investigate how environmental inputs co-ordinately regulate sleep plasticity.},

  abstract = {Background: Imbalances in amount and timing of sleep are harmful to physical and mental health. Therefore, the study of the underlying mechanisms is of great biological importance. Proper timing and amount of sleep are regulated by both the circadian clock and homeostatic sleep drive. However, very little is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the circadian clock regulates sleep. In this study, we describe a novel role for diuretic hormone 31 (DH31), the fly homolog of the vertebrate neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide, as a circadian wake-promoting signal that awakens the fly in anticipation of dawn. Results: Analysis of loss-of-function and gain-of-function Drosophila mutants demonstrates that DH31 suppresses sleep late at night. DH31 is expressed by a subset of dorsal circadian clock neurons that also express the receptor for the circadian neuropeptide pigment-dispersing factor (PDF). PDF secreted by the ventral pacemaker subset of circadian clock neurons acts on PDF receptors in the DH31-expressing dorsal clock neurons to increase DH31 secretion before dawn. Activation of PDF receptors in DH31-positive DN1 specifically affects sleep and has no effect on circadian rhythms, thus constituting a dedicated locus for circadian regulation of sleep. Conclusions: We identified a novel signaling molecule (DH31) as part of a neuropeptide relay mechanism for circadian control of sleep. Our results indicate that outputs of the clock controlling sleep and locomotor rhythms are mediated via distinct neuronal pathways.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is emerging as a promising model system for the genetic dissection of sleep. As in mammals, sleep in the fruit fly is a reversible state of reduced responsiveness to the external world and has been defined using an array of behavioral, pharmacologic, molecular, and electrophysiologic criteria. A central feature of mammalian sleep is its homeostatic regulation by the amount of previous wakefulness. Dissecting the mechanisms of homeostatic regulation is likely to provide key insights into the functions of sleep. Thus, it is important to establish to what extent sleep homeostasis is similar between mammals and flies. This study was designed to determine whether in flies, as in mammals, (1) sleep rebound is dependent on prior time awake; (2) sleep deprivation affects the intensity, in addition to the duration, of sleep rebound; (3) sleep loss impairs vigilance and performance; (4) the sleep homeostatic response is conserved among different wild-type lines, and between female and male flies of the same line. DESIGN: Motor activity of individual flies was recorded at 1-minute intervals using the infrared Drosophila Activity Monitoring System during 2 baseline days; during 6, 12, and 24 hours of sleep deprivation; and during 2 days of recovery. Sleep was defined as any period of uninterrupted behavioral immobility lasting $\backslash$textgreater 5 minutes. Sleep continuity was measured by calculating the number of brief awakenings, the number and duration of sleep episodes, and a sleep continuity score. Vigilance before and after sleep deprivation was assessed by measuring the escape response triggered by 2 different aversive stimuli. SETTING: Fly sleep research laboratory at UW-Madison. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Adult flies of the Canton-S (CS) strain and 116 other wild-type lines ($\backslash$textgreater or = 16 female and $\backslash$textgreater or = 16 male flies per line). MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: In wild-type CS flies, as in mammals, the amount of sleep recovered after sleep deprivation was dependent on prior time awake. Relative to baseline sleep, recovery sleep in CS flies was less fragmented, with longer sleep episodes, and was associated with a higher arousal threshold. Sleep deprivation in CS flies also reduced performance. Sleep duration and continuity increased after 24 hour of sleep deprivation in all the other wild-type lines tested. CONCLUSION: The sleep homeostatic response in fruit flies is a stable phenotype and shares most of, if not all, the major features of mammalian sleep homeostasis, thus supporting the use of Drosophila as a model system for the genetic dissection of sleep mechanisms and functions.},

  abstract = {Quiescence, or a sleep-like state, is a common and important feature of the daily lives of animals from both invertebrate and vertebrate taxa, suggesting that sleep appeared early in animal evolution. Recently, Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to be a relevant and powerful model for the genetic analysis of sleep behaviour. The sleep architecture of D. melanogaster is sexually dimorphic, with females sleeping much less than males during day-time, presumably because reproductive success requires greater foraging activity by the female as well as the search for egg-laying sites. However, this loss of sleep and increase in locomotor activity will heighten the risk for the female from environmental and predator hazards. In this study, we show that virgin females can minimize this risk by behaving like males, with an extended afternoon 'siesta'. Copulation results in the female losing 70 per cent of day-time sleep and becoming more active. This behaviour lasts for at least 8 days after copulation and is abolished if the mating males lack sex peptide (SP), normally present in the seminal fluid. Our results suggest that SP is the molecular switch that promotes wakefulness in the post-mated female, a change of behaviour compatible with increased foraging and egg-laying activity. The stress resulting from SP-dependent sleep deprivation might be an important contribution to the toxic side-effects of male accessory gland products that are known to reduce lifespan in post-mated females.},

  abstract = {Many insects are known to exhibit clear circadian rest-activity rhythms. Attention has focussed more on active behaviors such as locomotion than on rest. I investigated the consequences of disturbances of the rest period on activity states of the cockroach Leucophea maderae. The 24-h rest-activity rhythm of individual animals maintained under a 12 h light-12 h dark schedule was continuously recorded by timelapse video recording. Three activity states were scored: locomotion, immobility, and limb or antenna movements without locomotion. The effect of (i) 3 h forced activity; and of (ii) handling and a new environment was studied. Forced activity during the last 3 h of the light period caused a significant reduction of locomotion, and of limb or antenna movements; and an enhancement of immobility in the first hours of the dark period. However, over the entire 12 h dark period, these parameters did not differ from control. Brief handling in conjunction with a change in environment during the last 3 h of the dark period, was followed by similar, though smaller changes in locomotion as seen after forced locomotion. The results indicate that the time spent in immobility corresponds to a resting state which is regulated as a function of prior activity. Thus immobility in an invertebrate may exhibit similar regulating mechanisms as rest or sleep in vertebrates. ?? 1983.},

Short-term memory (STM) or long-term memory (LTM) was evaluated in rutabaga (rut) and dunce (dnc) mutants using aversive phototaxic suppression and courtship conditioning. Each of the three independent strategies increased sleep and restored memory to rut and dnc mutants. Importantly, inducing sleep also reverses memory defects in a Drosophila model of Alzheimer's disease. Together, these data demonstrate that sleep plays a more fundamental role in modulating behavioral plasticity than previously appreciated and suggest that increasing sleep may benefit patients with certain neurological disorders.},

Drosophila melanogaster males (but not females) perform an elaborate and innate courtship ritual directed toward females (but not males). Male courtship requires products of the fruitless (fru) gene, which is spliced differently in males and females. We have generated alleles of fru that are constitutively spliced in either the male or the female mode. We show that male splicing is essential for male courtship behavior and sexual orientation. More importantly, male splicing is also sufficient to generate male behavior in otherwise normal females. These females direct their courtship toward other females (or males engineered to produce female pheromones). The splicing of a single neuronal gene thus specifies essentially all aspects of a complex innate behavior. Copyright \textcopyright{}2005 by Elsevier Inc.},

Using this method, we were able to measure the volume ingested in single sips of an individual, and monitor the absorption of food with high temporal resolution. We demonstrate that flies ingest food by rhythmically extending their proboscis with a frequency that is not modulated by the internal state of the animal. Instead, hunger and satiety homeostatically modulate the microstructure of feeding.

  abstract = {How might one determine whether simple animals such as flies sleep in stages? Sleep in mammals is a dynamic process involving different stages of sleep intensity, and these are typically associated with measurable changes in brain activity (Blake and Gerard, 1937; Rechtschaffen and Kales, 1968; Webb and Agnew, 1971). Evidence for different sleep stages in invertebrates remains elusive, even though it has been well established that many invertebrate species require sleep (Campbell and Tobler, 1984; Hendricks et al., 2000; Shaw et al., 2000; Sauer et al., 2003). Here we used electrophysiology and arousal-testing paradigms to show that the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, transitions between deeper and lighter sleep within extended bouts of inactivity, with deeper sleep intensities after $\sim$15 and $\sim$30 min of inactivity. As in mammals, the timing and intensity of these dynamic sleep processes in flies is homeostatically regulated and modulated by behavioral experience. Two molecules linked to synaptic plasticity regulate the intensity of the first deep sleep stage. Optogenetic upregulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate during the day increases sleep intensity at night, whereas loss of function of a molecule involved in synaptic pruning, the fragile-X mental retardation protein, increases sleep intensity during the day. Our results show that sleep is not homogenous in insects, and suggest that waking behavior and the associated synaptic plasticity mechanisms determine the timing and intensity of deep sleep stages in Drosophila.},

  abstract = {Sleep was analysed in 8 young adults subjects during two baseline nights and two recovery nights following 40.5 h sleep deprivation. Sleep stages were scored from the polygraph records according to conventional criteria. In addition, the EEG records of the entire nights were subjected to spectral analysis to compute the frequency distribution of the power density in the 0.25-25 Hz range for 0.5 Hz or 1.0 Hz bins. In the first recovery night, the power density in the delta band was significantly higher than baseline for total sleep time as well as for sleep stages 2, 3 and 4, 4 and REM. These changes were not restricted to the delta band, but extended to higher frequency bands. Minor, but significant, effects of sleep deprivation were seen in the power density distribution of the second recovery night. In the baseline nights, a progressive reduction of power density in the delta/theta range was present for successive non-REM-REM sleep cycles for total sleep time and stages 2, 3 and 4, and 4. The results show that effects of sleep deprivation as well as trends within the sleep periods are readily apparent from spectral analysis, but are inadequately reflected by conventional sleep scoring. When the power density values were integrated over the entire frequency range (0.75-25 Hz) for each non-REM-REM sleep cycle, an exponential decline from cycle 1 to cycle 3 was suggested. The present findings support the hypothesis that the EEG power density in the low frequency range is an indicator of a progressively declining process during sleep whose initial value is determined by the duration of prior waking.},

To determine whether the lLNvs are involved in arousal and sleep/wake behavior, we examined the effects of altered electrical excitation of the LNvs. Results: LNv-hyperexcited flies reverse the normal day-night firing pattern, showing higher lLNv firing rates at night and pigment-dispersing-factor-mediated enhancement of nocturnal locomotor-activity behavior and reduced quantity and quality of sleep. lLNv hyperexcitation impairs sensory arousal, as shown by physiological and behavioral assays. lLNv-hyperexcited flies lacking sLNvs exhibit robust hyperexcitation-induced increases in nocturnal behavior, suggesting that the sLNvs are not essential for mediation of arousal.

  abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a diurnal insect active during the day with consolidated sleep at night. Social interactions between pairs of flies have been shown to affect locomotor activity patterns, but effects on locomotion and sleep patterns have not been assessed for larger populations. Here, we use a commercially available locomotor activity monitor (LAM25H) system to record and analyze sleep behavior. Surprisingly, we find that same-sex populations of flies synchronize their sleep/wake activity, resulting in a population sleep pattern, which is similar but not identical to that of isolated individuals. Like individual flies, groups of flies show circadian and homeostatic regulation of sleep, as well as sexual dimorphism in sleep pattern and sensitivity to starvation and a known sleep-disrupting mutation ( amnesiac ). Populations of flies, however, exhibit distinct sleep characteristics from individuals. Differences in sleep appear to be due to olfaction-dependent social interactions and change with population size and sex ratio. These data support the idea that it is possible to investigate neural mechanisms underlying the effects of population behaviors on sleep by directly looking at a large number of animals in laboratory conditions.},

  abstract = {Dysregulation of sleep is associated with metabolic diseases, and metabolic rate is acutely regulated by sleep-wake behavior. In humans and rodent models, sleep loss is associated with obesity, reduced metabolic rate, and negative energy balance, yet little is known about the neural mechanisms governing interactions between sleep and metabolism. We have developed a system to simultaneously measure sleep and metabolic rate in individual Drosophila, allowing for interrogation of neural systems governing interactions between sleep and metabolic rate. Like mammals, metabolic rate in flies is reduced during sleep and increased during sleep deprivation suggesting sleep-dependent regulation of metabolic rate is conserved across phyla. The reduction of metabolic rate during sleep is not simply a consequence of inactivity because metabolic rate is reduced $\sim$30 minutes following the onset of sleep, raising the possibility that CO2 production provides a metric to distinguish different sleep states in the fruit fly. To examine the relationship between sleep and metabolism, we determined basal and sleep-dependent changes in metabolic rate is reduced in starved flies, suggesting that starvation inhibits normal sleep-associated effects on metabolic rate. Further, translin mutant flies that fail to suppress sleep during starvation demonstrate a lower basal metabolic rate, but this rate was further reduced in response to starvation, revealing that regulation of starvation-induced changes in metabolic rate and sleep duration are genetically distinct. Therefore, this system provides the unique ability to simultaneously measure sleep and oxidative metabolism, providing novel insight into the physiological changes associated with sleep and wakefulness in the fruit fly.},

  abstract = {Sleep has many important biological functions, but how sleep is regulated remains poorly understood. In humans, social isolation and other stressors early in life can disrupt adult sleep. In fruit flies housed at different population densities during early adulthood, social enrichment was shown to increase subsequent sleep, but it is unknown if population density during early development can also influence adult sleep. To answer this question, we maintained Drosophila larvae at a range of population densities throughout larval development, kept them isolated during early adulthood, and then tested their sleep patterns. Our findings reveal that flies that had been isolated as larvae had more fragmented sleep than those that had been raised at higher population densities. This effect was more prominent in females than in males. Larval population density did not affect sleep in female flies that were mutant for amnesiac, which has been shown to be required for normal memory consolidation, adult sleep regulation, and brain development. In contrast, larval population density effects on sleep persisted in female flies lacking the olfactory receptor or83b, suggesting that olfactory signals are not required for the effects of larval population density on adult sleep. These findings show that population density during early development can alter sleep behavior in adulthood, suggesting that genetic and/or structural changes are induced by this developmental manipulation that persist through metamorphosis.},

These flies also had increased expression levels of a subset of anti-microbial peptide mRNA prior to infection, as well as increased NF$\kappa$B activity during infection as indicated by in vivo luciferase reporter activity. In contrast, flies that experienced reduced sleep for up to two days prior to infection had no effect on survival or on NF$\kappa$B activity during infection. However, flies with reduced sleep showed an altered defense mechanism, such that resistance to infection was increased, but at the expense of reduced tolerance.

  abstract = {Patterns of behavior within societies have long been visualized and interpreted using maps. Mapping the occurrence of sleep across individuals within a society could offer clues as to functional aspects of sleep. In spite of this, a detailed spatial analysis of sleep has never been conducted on an invertebrate society. We introduce the concept of mapping sleep across an insect society, and provide an empirical example, mapping sleep patterns within colonies of European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Honey bees face variables such as temperature and position of resources within their colony's nest that may impact their sleep. We mapped sleep behavior and temperature of worker bees and produced maps of their nest's comb contents as the colony grew and contents changed. By following marked bees, we discovered that individuals slept in many locations, but bees of different worker castes slept in different areas of the nest relative to position of the brood and surrounding temperature. Older worker bees generally slept outside cells, closer to the perimeter of the nest, in colder regions, and away from uncapped brood. Younger worker bees generally slept inside cells and closer to the center of the nest, and spent more time asleep than awake when surrounded by uncapped brood. The average surface temperature of sleeping foragers was lower than the surface temperature of their surroundings, offering a possible indicator of sleep for this caste. We propose mechanisms that could generate caste-dependent sleep patterns and discuss functional significance of these patterns.},

Although these two systems can operate independently, recent studies indicate a more intimate relationship. To study the interaction between homeostatic and circadian processes in Drosophila, we examined homeostasis in the canonical loss-of-function clock mutants period (per01), timeless (tim01), clock (Clkjrk) and cycle (cyc01). cyc01 mutants showed a disproportionately large sleep rebound and died after 10 hours of sleep deprivation, although they were more resistant than other clock mutants to various stressors. Unlike other clock mutants, cyc01 flies showed a reduced expression of heat-shock genes after sleep loss. However, activating heat-shock genes before sleep deprivation rescued cyc01 flies from its lethal effects. Consistent with the protective effect of heat-shock genes, was the observation that flies carrying a mutation for the heat-shock protein Hsp83 (Hsp8308445) showed exaggerated homeostatic response and died after sleep deprivation. These data represent the first step in identifying the molecular mechanisms that constitute the sleep homeostat.},

  issn = {0161-8105},
  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: It has been hypothesized that sleep deprivation represents an oxidative challenge for the brain and that sleep may have a protective role against oxidative damage. This study was designed to test this hypothesis by measuring in rats the effects of sleep loss on markers of oxidative stress (oxidant production and antioxidant enzyme activities) as well as on markers of cellular oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation). DESIGN: The analyses were performed in the brain and in peripheral tissues (liver and skeletal muscle), after short-term sleep deprivation (8 hours), after long-term sleep deprivation (3-14 days), and during recovery sleep after 1 week of sleep loss. Short-term sleep deprivation was performed by gentle handling; long-term sleep deprivation was performed using the disk-over-water method. SETTING: Sleep research laboratory at University of Wisconsin-Madison. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Adult male Wistar Kyoto rats (n = 69) implanted for polygraphic (electroencephalogram, electromyogram) recording. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Aliquots of brain, liver, or skeletal muscle homogenate were used to assess oxidant production, superoxide dismutase activity, lipid peroxidation, and protein oxidation. No evidence of oxidative damage was observed at the lipid and/or at the protein level in long-term sleep-deprived animals relative to their yoked controls, nor in the cerebral cortex or in peripheral tissues. Also, no consistent change in antioxidant enzymatic activities was found after prolonged sleep deprivation, nor was any evidence of increased oxidant production in the brain or in peripheral tissues. CONCLUSION: The available data do not support the assumption that prolonged wakefulness may cause oxidative damage, nor that it can represent an oxidative stress for the brain or for peripheral tissue such as liver and skeletal muscle.},

However, a defining criterion for sleep is decreased behavioral responsiveness to stimuli. Here we introduce the Drosophila ARousal Tracking system (DART), an integrated platform for efficiently tracking and probing arousal levels in animals. This video-based platform delivers positional and locomotion data, behavioral responsiveness to stimuli, sleep intensity measures, and homeostatic regulation effects - all in one combined system. We show how insight into dynamically changing arousal thresholds is crucial for any sleep study in flies. We first find that arousal probing uncovers different sleep intensity profiles among related genetic background strains previously assumed to have equivalent sleep patterns. We then show how sleep duration and sleep intensity can be uncoupled, with distinct manipulations of dopamine function producing opposite effects on sleep duration but similar sleep intensity defects. We conclude by providing a multi-dimensional assessment of combined arousal and locomotion metrics in the mutant and background strains. Our approach opens the door for deeper insights into mechanisms of sleep regulation and provides a new method for investigating the role of different genetic manipulations in controlling sleep and arousal.},

Mutation of core circadian genes blocks the immediate increase in daytime sleep, but not the heat-stimulated decrease in nighttime sleep, when animals are in a light:dark cycle. The ability of per01 flies to increase daytime sleep in light:dark can be rescued by expression of PER in either LNv or DN1p clock cells and does not require rescue of locomotor rhythms. Prolonged heat exposure engages the homeostat to maintain daytime sleep in the face of nighttime sleep loss. In constant darkness, all genotypes show an immediate decrease in sleep in response to temperature shift during the subjective day, implying that the absence of light input uncovers a clock-independent pro-arousal effect of increased temperature. Interestingly, the effects of temperature on nighttime sleep are blunted in constant darkness and in cryOUT mutants in light:dark, suggesting that they are dependent on the presence of light the previous day. In contrast, flies of all genotypes kept in constant light sleep more at all times of day in response to high temperature, indicating that the presence of light can invert the normal nighttime response to increased temperature. The effect of temperature on sleep thus reflects coordinated regulation by light, the homeostat, and components of the clock, allowing animals to reorganize sleep patterns in response to high temperature with rough preservation of the total amount of sleep.},

Using real-time assessments of tetramethylammonium diffusion and two-photon imaging in live mice, we show that natural sleep or anesthesia are associated with a 60\% increase in the interstitial space, resulting in a striking increase in convective exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with interstitial fluid. In turn, convective fluxes of interstitial fluid increased the rate of $\beta$-amyloid clearance during sleep. Thus, the restorative function of sleep may be a consequence of the enhanced removal of potentially neurotoxic waste products that accumulate in the awake central nervous system.},

  abstract = {Female Drosophila melanogaster, like many other organisms, exhibit different behavioral repertoires after mating with a male. These postmating responses (PMRs) include increased egg production and laying, increased rejection behavior (avoiding further male advances), decreased longevity, altered gustation and decreased sleep. Sex Peptide (SP), a protein transferred from the male during copulation, is largely responsible for many of these behavioral responses, and acts through a specific circuit to induce rejection behavior and alter dietary preference. However, less is known about the mechanisms and neurons that influence sleep in mated females. In this study, we investigated postmating changes in female sleep across strains and ages and on different media, and report that these changes are robust and relatively consistent under a variety of conditions. We find that female sleep is reduced by male-derived SP acting through the canonical sex peptide receptor (SPR) within the same neurons responsible for altering other PMRs. This circuit includes the SPSN-SAG neurons, whose silencing by DREADD induces postmating behaviors including sleep. Our data are consistent with the idea that mating status is communicated to the central brain through a common circuit that diverges in higher brain centers to modify a collection of postmating sensorimotor processes.},

We also show that molecular correlates of sleep are found in the cerebellum, a structure not known for generating sleep rhythms. Finally, we show that different functional categories of genes are selectively associated with sleep and wakefulness.

  doi = {10.1186/1471-2202-11-17},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immune challenge impacts behavior in many species. In mammals, this adaptive behavior is often manifested as an increase in sleep. Sleep has therefore been proposed to benefit the host by enhancing immune function and thereby overcome the challenge. To facilitate genetic studies on the relationship between sleep and immune function, we characterized the effect of the immune response on sleep in Drosophila melanogaster. Behavioral features of sleep as well as the innate immune response signaling pathways are well characterized in flies and are highly conserved in mammals. RESULTS: An immune response induced by infection with Gram-negative bacteria or by aseptic injury increased sleep in flies. The increase in sleep occurred during the morning hours after treatment and the magnitude of the effect was dependent on the time-of-day of inoculation or injury such that night-time treatment had a stronger effect than that during the daytime. This pattern persisted in constant darkness, indicating a role of the circadian clock. Mutants of the circadian clock gene, period, eliminated the increase in sleep observed in the morning, but instead showed enhanced sleep immediately after injury or infection.Null mutants of the Nuclear Factor kappaB (NFkappaB) Relish, which is central to the innate immune response, do not increase sleep in response to injury or infection at any time of day. Instead, they maintain a normal sleep pattern until they die. Expression of a full-length Relish transgene in the fat bodies of Relish mutants restored the morning increase in sleep during an immune response. Fat bodies are a major site of immune signalling in flies and have a key role in host defense. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that an immune response increases sleep in flies in a manner that is gated by the circadian clock and that requires the NFkappaB Relish. These findings support a role of sleep in a recovery process and demonstrate a conserved feature of the Drosophila model of sleep.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Several lines of evidence indicate that sleep plays a critical role in learning and memory. The aim of this study was to evaluate anesthesia resistant memory following sleep deprivation in Drosophila. DESIGN: Four to 16 h after aversive olfactory training, flies were sleep deprived for 4 h. Memory was assessed 24 h after training. Training, sleep deprivation, and memory tests were performed at different times during the day to evaluate the importance of the time of day for memory formation. The role of circadian rhythms was further evaluated using circadian clock mutants. RESULTS: Memory was disrupted when flies were exposed to 4 h of sleep deprivation during the consolidation phase. Interestingly, normal memory was observed following sleep deprivation when the memory test was performed during the 2 h preceding lights-off, a period characterized by maximum wake in flies. We also show that anesthesia resistant memory was less sensitive to sleep deprivation in flies with disrupted circadian rhythms. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that anesthesia resistant memory, a consolidated memory less costly than long-term memory, is sensitive to sleep deprivation. In addition, we provide evidence that circadian factors influence memory vulnerability to sleep deprivation and memory retrieval. Taken together, the data show that memories weakened by sleep deprivation can be retrieved if the animals are tested at the optimal circadian time.},

  abstract = {In the last three decades the two-process model of sleep regulation has served as a major conceptual framework in sleep research. It has been applied widely in studies on fatigue and performance and to dissect individual differences in sleep regulation. The model posits that a homeostatic process (Process S) interacts with a process controlled by the circadian pacemaker (Process C), with time-courses derived from physiological and behavioural variables. The model simulates successfully the timing and intensity of sleep in diverse experimental protocols. Electrophysiological recordings from the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) suggest that S and C interact continuously. Oscillators outside the SCN that are linked to energy metabolism are evident in SCN-lesioned arrhythmic animals subjected to restricted feeding or methamphetamine administration, as well as in human subjects during internal desynchronization. In intact animals these peripheral oscillators may dissociate from the central pacemaker rhythm. A sleep/fast and wake/feed phase segregate antagonistic anabolic and catabolic metabolic processes in peripheral tissues. A deficiency of Process S was proposed to account for both depressive sleep disturbances and the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation. The model supported the development of novel non-pharmacological treatment paradigms in psychiatry, based on manipulating circadian phase, sleep and light exposure. In conclusion, the model remains conceptually useful for promoting the integration of sleep and circadian rhythm research. Sleep appears to have not only a short-term, use-dependent function; it also serves to enforce rest and fasting, thereby supporting the optimization of metabolic processes at the appropriate phase of the 24-h cycle.},

Furthermore, a moderate reduction in SLEEPLESS protein has minimal effects on baseline sleep, but markedly reduces recovery sleep following sleep deprivation.

The synaptic homeostasis hypothesis (SHY) proposes that sleep is the price the brain pays for plasticity. During a waking episode, learning statistical regularities about the current environment requires strengthening connections throughout the brain. This increases cellular needs for energy and supplies, decreases signal-to-noise ratios, and saturates learning. During sleep, spontaneous activity renormalizes net synaptic strength and restores cellular homeostasis. Activity-dependent down-selection of synapses can also explain the benefits of sleep on memory acquisition, consolidation, and integration. This happens through the offline, comprehensive sampling of statistical regularities incorporated in neuronal circuits over a lifetime. This Perspective considers the rationale and evidence for SHY and points to open issues related to sleep and plasticity.},

  abstract = {According to a widely held concept, the formation of long-term memories relies on a reactivation and redistribution of newly acquired memory representations from temporary storage to neuronal networks supporting long-term storage. Here, we review evidence showing that this process of system consolidation takes place preferentially during sleep as an 'off-line' period during which memories are spontaneously reactivated and redistributed in the absence of interfering external inputs. Moreover, postlearning sleep leads to a reorganization of neuronal representations and qualitative changes of memory content. We propose that memory reactivations during sleep are accompanied by a transient destabilization of memory traces. Unlike wake reactivations that form part of an updating of memories with respect to current perceptual input, reactivations during sleep allow for gradually adapting newly acquired memories to pre-existing long-term memories whereby invariants and certain other features of these memories become extracted.},

The zebrafish provides a powerful vertebrate model system that enables simple genetic manipulation, imaging of neuronal circuits and synapses in living animals, and the monitoring of behavioral performance during day and night. Thus, the zebrafish has become an attractive model to study circadian and homeostatic processes that regulate sleep. Zebrafish clock- and sleep-related genes have been cloned, neuronal circuits that exhibit circadian rhythms of activity and synaptic plasticity have been studied, and rhythmic behavioral outputs have been characterized. Integration of this data could lead to a better understanding of sleep regulation. Here, we review the progress of circadian clock and sleep studies in zebrafish with special emphasis on the genetic and neuroendocrine mechanisms that regulate rhythms of melatonin secretion, structural synaptic plasticity, locomotor activity and sleep.},

  abstract = {In all animals, sleep pressure is under continuous tight regulation. It is universally accepted that this regulation arises from a two-process model, integrating both a circadian and a homeostatic controller. Here we explore the role of environmental social signals as a third, parallel controller of sleep homeostasis and sleep pressure. We show that, in Drosophila melanogaster males, sleep pressure after sleep deprivation can be counteracted by raising their sexual arousal, either by engaging the flies with prolonged courtship activity or merely by exposing them to female pheromones., Humans spend one-third of their lifetime sleeping, but why we (and other animals) need to sleep remains an unresolved mystery of biology. Our desire to sleep changes depending on how much sleep we've already had. If we've had a long nap during the day, we may find it harder to fall asleep at night; conversely, if we stay up all night partying, we'll have a difficult time staying alert the next day. This change in the pressure to sleep is known as ``sleep homeostasis''., Can sleep homeostasis be suppressed? We know that some migratory birds are able to resist sleep while flying over the ocean. In addition, males of an Arctic bird species forgo sleep for courtship during the three-week window every year when females of its species are fertile. These examples suggest that some behavioral or environmental factors may influence sleep homeostasis., Beckwith et al. now show that sexual arousal can disrupt sleep homeostasis in fruit flies. In ``blind date'' experiments, young male fruit flies were kept in a small tube with female fruit flies, prompting a 24-hour period of courtship and mating. The males went without sleep during that period, and they did not make up for the lost sleep afterward., In other experiments, male fruit flies were kept awake by a robot that disturbed them every time they tried to sleep. After such treatment, the flies normally attempted to nap. But if the sleep-deprived flies were exposed to a chemical emitted by female flies that increased their sexual arousal, they no longer needed to sleep., Overall, the results presented by Beckwith et al. show that sleep is a biological drive that can be overcome under certain conditions. This will be important for sleep researchers to remember, because it means that it's possible to affect sleep regulation (perhaps by making the animal stressed or aroused) without activating the brain circuits directly involved in regulating sleep.},

Arousal is fundamental to many behaviors, but whether it is unitary or whether there are different types of behavior-specific arousal has not been clear. In Drosophila, dopamine promotes sleep-wake arousal. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding its influence on environmentally stimulated arousal. Here we show that loss-of-function mutations in the D1 dopamine receptor DopR enhance repetitive startle-induced arousal while decreasing sleep-wake arousal (i.e., increasing sleep). These two types of arousal are also inversely influenced by cocaine, whose effects in each case are opposite to, and abrogated by, the DopR mutation. Selective restoration of DopR function in the central complex rescues the enhanced stimulated arousal but not the increased sleep phenotype of DopR mutants. These data provide evidence for at least two different forms of arousal, which are independently regulated by dopamine in opposite directions, via distinct neural circuits.},

Behavioral and imaging analyses suggested that dopamine is a stronger arousal signal than octopamine. Notably, light exposure not only suppressed l-LNv responses, but also synchronized responses of neighboring l-LNvs. This regulation occurred by distinct mechanisms: light-mediated suppression of octopamine responses was regulated by the circadian clock, whereas light regulation of dopamine responses occurred by upregulation of inhibitory dopamine receptors. Plasticity therefore alters the relative importance of diverse cues on the basis of the environmental mix of stimuli.

Why we sleep remains one of the enduring unanswered questions in biology. At its core, sleep can be defined behaviorally as a homeostatically regulated state of reduced movement and sensory responsiveness. The cornerstone of sleep studies in terrestrial mammals, including humans, has been the measurement of coordinated changes in brain activity during sleep measured using the electroencephalogram (EEG). Yet among a diverse set of animals, these EEG sleep traits can vary widely and, in some cases, are absent, raising questions as to whether they define~a universal, or even essential, feature of sleep. Over the~past decade, behaviorally defined sleep-like states have been identified in a series of genetic model organisms, including fish, flies and worms. Genetic analyses in these systems are revealing a remarkable conservation in the underlying mechanisms controlling sleep behavior. Taken together, these studies suggest an ancient origin for sleep and raise the possibility that model organism genetics may reveal the molecular mechanisms that guide sleep and wake.},

As in mammals, rest is abundant in young flies, is reduced in older flies, and is modulated by stimulants and hypnotics. Several molecular markers modulated by sleep and waking in mammals are modulated by rest and activity in Drosophila, including cytochrome oxidase C, the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein BiP, and enzymes implicated in the catabolism of monoamines. Flies lacking one such enzyme, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, show increased rest after rest deprivation. These results implicate the catabolism of monoamines in the regulation of sleep and waking in the fly and suggest that Drosophila may serve as a model system for the genetic dissection of sleep.},

  abstract = {Sleep is an important behaviour that has been observed in all animals studied so far, including Drosophila melanogaster. While a range of studies demonstrates that sleep is crucial to preserve an animal's cognitive and physical health, relatively little is known about its regulation. Specifically, the molecular mechanisms that regulate sleep are still unclear, although a strong heritable component prevails. While the gene network governing sleep timing \textendash{} the circadian system \textendash{} is comparatively well described, the network calibrating the sleep homeostat is still vague. The study of sleep-regulatory mechanisms was greatly advanced by the adoption of the relatively simple model organism Drosophila melanogaster. Following seminal studies that demonstrated the suitability of Drosophila for the study of sleep, several sleep mutants were identified. Among those, hyperkinetic \textendash{} a member of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) family of enzymes \textendash{} was one of the first Drosophila sleep mutants ever described. The abundance and importance of AKRs for human health and disease in combination with their conservation in Drosophila provides an excellent basis to examine whether AKRs systematically act as molecular regulators of sleep behaviour. Thus, we produced the first in silico study of potential Drosophila AKRs. We experimentally tested potential AKRs for neural sleep-regulatory roles through a nervous system-wide and Mushroom body-specific screen. We identified and further characterised the neural populations expressing particular candidates and the role these candidate AKRs fulfil to modulate sleep behaviour. We identified a novel AKR, CG10638, which specifically acts through a pair of wake-promoting peptidergic projection neurons termed ``inferior contralateral interneurons'' (ICLI) whose inhibition is necessary to relieve sleep pressure built up during the day, or specifically induced through dedicated sleep deprivation. We also demonstrate that ICLI neurons receive inputs from the major `clock' neurons of the fly brain, and show that CG10638 negatively regulates ICLI neurons to acutely gauge the sleep homeostat and to integrate sleep pressure with the circadian network. We also identified a Mushroom body-specific sleep-regulatory AKR, CG3397, that may be close to Hyperkinetic in structure and function.},

  abstract = {Black (Ctenosaura pectinata) and green (Iguana iguana) iguanid lizards were implanted with chronic electrodes in forebrain, orbital cavities and nuchal muscles; electrodes were also attached to abdominal cavity skin. Electrographic recordings were obtained for 7-11 consecutive days. Behavioral response latencies during behavioral wakefulness and behavioral sleep were evaluated. Four characteristic postures described the behavior of lizards: limbs flexed and supporting body, head and neck elevated, eyes open (active waking); posture similar to above, but with the body resting on floor (quiet waking); limbs slightly flexed or one to three limbs extended backward and positioned against body/tail, head rested on floor, eyes usually closed; all limbs extended backward and positioned against body/tail, head on floor, eyes usually closed. Frequency and latency of response to stimulation, respectively, changed from 94.1-100\% and 0.62-0.69 sec for behavioral waking to 50-51.3\% and 1.32-2.01 sec for Postures 3 and 4 (eyes closed). Postures 3 and 4 (eyes closed) denote behavioral sleep, i.e. stereotypic posture, immobility, increased response threshold, and rapid state reversibility. EEGs were dominated by small amplitude monophasic sharp and sawtooth waves during behavioral waking, but EEGs became polymorphic and irregular in form during behavioral sleep (EEG frequencies slightly declined and amplitudes substantially diminished with sleep). Neither epochs of slow waves nor paradoxical sleep were recorded. Arhythmic (up to 385 $\mu$V) spikes (25-80 msec duration) and sharp waves (80-190 msec duration) characterized lizard EEGs. Spike and sharp wave activity reached peak levels only during behavioral sleep and vanished or dramatically declined with waking. Spikes and sharp waves substantially increased during recovery from 48 hr of enforced waking.},

The mechanisms and molecules discovered in these simple animals are evolutionarily conserved in other species, including mammals. Sleep research lacks a simple animal model because criteria based on the electroencephalogram have been met only in birds and mammals. We argue that straightforward behavioral criteria could allow the identification of a sleep-like rest state that might be useful for molecular investigations to understand the regulation and function of sleep. Candidate model systems are discussed, leading to the conclusion that several species have complementary strengths. Specifically, techniques developed for larval zebrafish can be used to visualize neural firing patterns in the living animal, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been used successfully for molecular and genetic dissection of complex behaviors. We conclude with a hypothesis that one putative function of sleep, the optimization of neural plasticity, would also have adaptive value in simple organisms and might therefore be evolutionarily conserved.},

Previous comparative studies of sleep architecture found that larger mammals, those with bigger brains, and those with higher absolute basal metabolic rates (BMR) tended to engage in less SWS and REM sleep. Species experiencing a greater risk of predation also exhibited less SWS and REM sleep. In all cases, however, these studies lacked a formal phylogenetic and theoretical framework and used mainly correlational analyses. Using independent contrasts and an updated data set, we extended existing approaches with path analysis to examine the integrated influence of anatomy, physiology, and ecology on sleep architecture. Path model structure was determined by nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for the function of sleep. We found that species with higher relative BMRs engage in less SWS, whereas species with larger relative brain masses engage...},

In the mid-twentieth century, J. B. S. Haldane, P. B. Medawar and G. C. Williams informally argued that the force of natural selection falls with adult age. In 1966, W. D. Hamilton published formal equations that showed mathematically that two' forces of natural selection' do indeed decline with age, though his analysis was not genetically explicit. Brian Charlesworth then developed the required mathematical population genetics for the evolution of ageing in the 1970's. In the 1980's, experiments using Drosophila showed that the rate of ageing evolves as predicted by Hamilton's' forces of natural selection'. The discovery of the cessation of ageing late in life in the 1990's was followed by its explanation in terms of evolutionary theory based on Hamilton's forces. Recently, it has been shown that the cessation of ageing can also be manipulated experimentally using Hamilton's' forces of natural selection'. Despite the success of evolutionary research on ageing, mainstream gerontological research has largely ignored both this work and the opportunity that it provides for effective intervention in ageing.},

Do all animals sleep? Sleep has been observed in many vertebrates, and there is a growing body of evidence for sleep-like states in arthropods and nematodes [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Here we show that sleep is also present in Cnidaria [6, 7, 8], an earlier-branching metazoan lineage. Cnidaria and Ctenophora are the first metazoan phyla to evolve tissue-level organization and differentiated cell types, such as neurons and muscle [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. In Cnidaria, neurons are organized into a~non-centralized radially symmetric nerve net [11, 13, 15, 16, 17] that nevertheless shares fundamental properties with the vertebrate nervous system: action potentials, synaptic transmission, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. It was reported that cnidarian soft corals [21] and box jellyfish [22, 23] exhibit periods of quiescence, a pre-requisite for sleep-like states, prompting us to ask whether sleep is present in Cnidaria. Within Cnidaria, the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea spp. displays a quantifiable pulsing behavior, allowing us to perform long-term behavioral tracking. Monitoring of Cassiopea pulsing activity for consecutive days and nights revealed behavioral quiescence at night that is rapidly reversible, as well as a delayed response to stimulation in the quiescent state. When deprived of nighttime quiescence, Cassiopea exhibited decreased activity and reduced responsiveness to a sensory stimulus during the subsequent day, consistent with homeostatic regulation of the quiescent state. Together, these results indicate that Cassiopea has a sleep-like state, supporting the hypothesis that sleep arose early in the metazoan lineage, prior to the emergence of a centralized nervous system.},

The difficulty in understanding these functions can be at least partly attributed to the varied manifestations of sleep in different animals. Daily sleep duration can range from 4\textendash{}20~hrs among mammals, and sleep can manifest throughout the brain, or it can alternate over time between cerebral hemispheres, depending on the species. Ecological factors are likely to have shaped these and other sleep behaviors during evolution by altering the properties of conserved arousal circuits in the brain. Nonetheless, core functions of sleep are likely to have arisen early and to have persisted to the present day in diverse organisms.

  abstract = {Summary
Sleep is recognized to be ancient in origin, with vertebrates and invertebrates experiencing behaviorally quiescent states that are regulated by conserved genetic mechanisms [1, 2]. Despite its conservation throughout phylogeny, the function of sleep remains debated. Hypotheses for the purpose of sleep include nervous-system-specific functions such as modulation of synaptic strength and clearance of metabolites from the brain [3, 4], as well as more generalized cellular functions such as energy conservation and macromolecule biosynthesis [5]. These models are supported by the identification of synaptic and metabolic processes that are perturbed during prolonged wakefulness. It remains to be seen whether perturbations of cellular homeostasis in turn drive sleep. Here we show that under conditions of cellular stress, including noxious heat, cold, hypertonicity, and tissue damage, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans engages a behavioral quiescence program. The stress-induced quiescent state displays properties of sleep and is~dependent on the ALA neuron, which mediates the conserved soporific effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) ligand overexpression. We characterize heat-induced quiescence in detail and show that it is indeed dependent on components of EGF signaling, providing physiological relevance to the behavioral effects of EGF family ligands. We find that after noxious heat exposure, quiescence-defective animals show elevated expression of cellular stress reporter genes and are impaired for survival, demonstrating the benefit of stress-induced behavioral quiescence. These data provide evidence that cellular stress can induce a protective sleep-like state in C.~elegans and suggest that a deeply conserved function of sleep is to mitigate disruptions of cellular homeostasis.},

Homeostasis of sleep-like behavior is observed during C. elegans lethargus, a 2-3 hour behavioral quiescent period that occurs during larval state transitions []. Here, we report a role for DAF-16/FOXO, a transcription factor that is active under conditions of stress [], in the response to deprivation of lethargus quiescence. Forced locomotion during lethargus results in nuclear translocation of DAF-16. The formation of dauer larvae, a developmental state promoted by daf-16, is increased in response to quiescence deprivation. daf-16 mutants show an impaired homeostatic response to deprivation of lethargus quiescence, and are hypersensitive to the lethal effects of forced locomotion during lethargus. DAF-16 expression in muscle cells but not in neurons is sufficient to restore a homeostatic response to deprivation of quiescence, pointing to a role for muscle in sleep homeostasis. These findings are relevant to clinical observations of altered metabolic signaling in response to sleep deprivation and suggest that these signaling pathways may act in non-neuronal tissue to regulate sleep behaviors.},

  abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: The nematode C. elegans develops through four larval stages before it reaches adulthood. At the transition between stages and before it sheds its cuticle, it exhibits a sleep-like behavior during a stage termed lethargus. The objectives of this study were to characterize in detail behavioral patterns and physiological activity of a command interneuron during lethargus.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We found that lethargus behavior was composed of bouts of quiescence and motion. The duration of individual bouts ranged from 2 to 100 seconds, and their dynamics exhibited local homeostasis: the duration of bouts of quiescence positively correlated with the duration of bouts of motion that immediately preceded them in a cAMP-dependent manner. In addition, we identified a characteristic body posture during lethargus: the average curvature along the body of L4 lethargus larvae was lower than that of L4 larvae prior to lethargus, and the positions of body bends were distributed non-uniformly along the bodies of quiescent animals. Finally, we found that the AVA interneurons, a pair of backward command neurons, mediated locomotion patterns during L4 lethargus in similar fashion to their function in L4 larvae prior to lethargus. Interestingly, in both developmental stages backward locomotion was initiated and terminated asymmetrically with respect to AVA intraneuronal calcium concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: The complex behavioral patterns during lethargus can be dissected to quantifiable elements, which exhibit rich temporal dynamics and are actively regulated by the nervous system. Our findings support the identification of lethargus as a sleep-like state.

Rats respond to sustained sleep deprivation with increased mortality preceded by a rise in resting metabolic rate that may or may not be attributed to dysfunction of the thermoregulatory system. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that deprivation of sleep-like rest will lead to increased metabolic rate in an ectothermic insect, the Pacific beetle cockroach. A mild alerting stimulus consisting of a brief $<$1\% pulse of CO2 and simultaneous 2 s rotation (1 cm motion) of the animal chamber consistently prevented the adoption of a sleep-like resting posture in cockroaches. Two groups of 15 male adult cockroaches were studied; a group targeted for deprivation of sleep-like rest (SD) was presented with one stimulus per minute continuously, and a group of stimulus controls (SC) was given the same number of stimuli per day but scheduled such that the animals received a 3 h interval without stimuli four times per day. This protocol led to significantly increased mortality in the SD group beginning on day 17 (averaging 0.57 deaths per day thereafter), but not in the SC group (averaging 0.17 deaths per day throughout). Oxygen consumption (V\.O2) increased significantly after 4 weeks in the SD group but not the SC group. V\.O2 was 82\% above pre-deprivation baseline after 35 days in the SD group (P=0.009). Body mass was unchanged throughout. We conclude that sleep-like rest is essential for long-term viability in insects and that prolonged vigilance leads to an increase in whole-animal metabolic rate in this ectothermic species.},

Restrained bees were observed by a web camera, and their antennal activities were used as indicators of sleep. We found that the bees sleep more during the dark phase of the day compared with the light phase. Sleep phases were characterized by two distinct patterns of antennal activities: symmetrical activity, more prominent during the dark phase; and asymmetrical activity, more common during the light phase. Sleep-deprived bees showed rebound the following day, confirming effective deprivation of sleep. After appetitive conditioning of the bees to various olfactory stimuli, we observed their sleep. Bees conditioned to odor with sugar reward showed lesser sleep compared with bees that were exposed to either reward alone or air alone. Next, we asked whether sleep deprivation affects memory consolidation. While sleep deprivation had no effect on retention scores after odor acquisition, retention for extinction learning was significantly reduced, indicating that consolidation of extinction memory but not acquisition memory was affected by sleep deprivation.},

In humans, one of the most profound consequences of sleep deprivation is imprecise or irrational communication, demonstrated by degradation in signaling as well as in receiving information. Communication in nonhuman animals may suffer analogous degradation of precision, perhaps with especially damaging consequences for social animals. However, society-specific consequences of sleep loss have rarely been explored, and no function of sleep has been ascribed to a truly social (eusocial) organism in the context of its society. Here we show that sleep-deprived honey bees (Apis mellifera) exhibit reduced precision when signaling direction information to food sources in their waggle dances. The deterioration of the honey bee's ability to communicate is expected to reduce the foraging efficiency of nestmates. This study demonstrates the impact of sleep deprivation on signaling in a eusocial animal. If the deterioration of signals made by sleep-deprived honey bees and humans is generalizable, then imprecise communication may be one detrimental effect of sleep loss shared by social organisms.},

  abstract = {Our objective was to investigate whether sleep-like states occur in the cockroach, Blaberus giganteus by applying the methods formerly used for another cockroach species, Leucophaea maderae and the scorpions, Heterometrus and Pandinus. The behaviour of isolated animals (n = 10) kept under LD 12:12 h was recorded by time-lapse video for three consecutive 24-h periods. Nine behavioural states were scored for 1-min real-time epochs. Rest was subdivided into 4 sub-states on the basis of body posture and the position of the antennae. The cockroaches showed a nocturnal behaviour exhibiting a bout of locomotion at dark onset which lasted several hours, and a preference for rest in the light period. Immobility with both the body and the antennae touching the substrate (state 1) was the predominating state in the light period. In order to establish whether the sub-states of rest represented different levels of vigilance the arousal threshold was measured by determining the latency of a behavioural response to a vibration stimulus. The levels of arousal differed significantly in four behavioural states in the light period but not in the dark period. In state 1 the animals exhibited the lowest arousal whereas in the activity states arousal was the highest. The state with the highest arousal threshold occurred in the beginning of the light period. Thereafter, arousal progressively increased and remained relatively high during the dark period. The effect of 6-h deprivation of rest by the gentle shaking of the cages whenever the animals were immobile, resulted in a reduced latency to state 1, a small increase of state 1 and a more prominent initial increase of activity during recovery. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the existence of a 24-h variation of vigilance in the cockroach. It further indicates that a 'rest deficit' gives rise to a compensatory response. The data support the notion that sleep-like states are present in these insects.},

The relationships between arthropod abundance (number of individuals), body size, and biomass are described for these five habitats, for the predicted arthropod fauna of a hectare of forest, and for different trophic groups. The results are similar for all five habitats; abundance decreases and biomass increases with body size. Broadly similar principles apply for herbivores, decomposers and predators but not for "tourists". Thus the "equal biomass hypothesis", which predicts roughly constant biomass across logarithmic size classes, is rejected. Previous studies have suggested that the fractal nature of surfaces is important in determining abundance-body size relationships in animal communities. These predict slopes of approximately -3.25 for log abundance against log body size. In this study the steepest slope was only -2.43. This suggests that the fractal nature of surfaces are less important in determining arthropod assemblages than has been considered. Two factors may account for the difference in predicted and observed slopes. First, the assumed metabolic rate component in fractal arguments (i.e. that metabolic rate scales with body size to the 0.75 power) is wrong, and second, smaller organisms are under-sampled from all habitats. Under-sampling of smaller organisms may also account, at least in part, for the observed slopes which result in our rejection of the "equal biomass hypothesis".},

Honeybee, Apis mellifera, foragers also shift their work schedules, but how flexible they are in the timing of sleep as they shift the timing of work is unknown, despite the importance of colony-level plasticity in the face of a changing environment. We hypothesized that sleep schedules of foragers are not fixed and instead vary depending on the time when food is available. We trained bees to visit a food source made available for several hours in the early morning (AM) or several hours in the late afternoon (PM), then monitored their sleep behaviour for 24h after training, specifically comparing their sleep during the AM and PM periods previously designated as training periods. Following AM training, honeybee foragers slept more during the afternoon than during the morning, but following PM training, the same bees `slept in' the next morning, and so slept more in the morning than in the afternoon. Although foragers did not change the total amount of time devoted to each of their behaviours (including sleep), the timing of their sleep did change. Thus, plasticity in timing of foraging was matched by plasticity in timing of sleep. The apparent correlation between the timing patterns of foraging and sleeping demonstrates temporal plasticity of sleep under ecologically realistic conditions in an invertebrate. Testing how shift work affects the health and performance of honeybees may shed light on the role of sleep in a nonhuman social animal.},

Sleep plays an important role in stabilizing new memory traces after learning [1\textendash{}3]. Here we investigate whether sleep's role in memory processing is similar in evolutionarily distant species and demonstrate that a context trigger during deep-sleep phases improves memory in invertebrates, as it does in humans. We show that in honeybees (Apis mellifera), exposure to an odor during deep sleep that has been present during learning improves memory performance the following day. Presentation of the context odor during wake phases or novel odors during sleep does not enhance memory. In humans, memory consolidation can be triggered by presentation of a context odor during slow-wave sleep that had been present during learning [3\textendash{}5]. Our results reveal that deep-sleep phases in honeybees have the potential to prompt memory consolidation, just~as they do in humans. This study provides strong evidence for a conserved role of sleep\textemdash{}and how it~affects memory processes\textemdash{}from insects to mammals.},

Honeybee (Apis mellifera) foragers are among the first invertebrates for which sleep behavior has been described. Foragers (typically older than 21 days) have strong circadian rhythms; they are active during the day, and sleep during the night. We explored whether young bees ($\sim$3 days of age), which are typically active around-the-clock with no circadian rhythms, also exhibit sleep behavior. We combined 24-hour video recordings, detailed behavioral observations, and analyses of response thresholds to a light pulse for individually housed bees in various arousal states. We characterized three sleep stages in foragers on the basis of differences in body posture, bout duration, antennae movements and response threshold. Young bees exhibited sleep behavior consisting of the same three stages as observed in foragers. Sleep was interrupted by brief awakenings, which were as frequent in young bees as in foragers. Beyond these similarities, we found differences in the sleep architecture of young bees and foragers. Young bees passed more frequently between the three sleep stages, and stayed longer in the lightest sleep stage than foragers. These differences in sleep architecture may represent developmental and/or environmentally induced variations in the neuronal network underlying sleep in honeybees. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence for plasticity in sleep behavior in insects.},

In addition to the sun, however, insects can also use the polarization pattern of the sky as a reference for estimating navigational directions. Recent analysis of polarization vision pathways in the brain of orthopteroid insects sheds some light onto brain areas that might act as internal navigation centers. Here I review the significance, peripheral mechanisms, and central processing stages for polarization vision in insects with special reference to the locust Schistocerca gregaria. As in other insect species, polarization vision in locusts relies on specialized photoreceptor cells in a small dorsal rim area of the compound eye. Stages in the brain involved in polarized light signaling include specific areas in the lamina, medulla and lobula of the optic lobe and, in the midbrain, the anterior optic tubercle, the lateral accessory lobe, and the central complex. Integration of polarized-light signals with information on solar position appears to start in the optic lobe. In the central complex, polarization-opponent interneurons form a network of interconnected neurons. The organization of the central complex, its connections to thoracic motor centers, and its involvement in the spatial control of locomotion strongly suggest that it serves as a spatial organizer within the insect brain, including the functions of compass orientation and path integration. Time compensation in compass orientation is possibly achieved through a neural pathway from the internal circadian clock in the accessory medulla to the protocerebral bridge of the central complex.},

  abstract = {:   Modern estimates of species-level diversity in the recent Mollusca range from 34,000 to 120,000 described species, with total diversity including undescribed species often cited as 200,000. Most estimates are unverifiable, not being based on reproducible methods. Ultimately the best way to gauge diversity is explicit enumeration: actual listing of known species. Comprehensive lists of species are valued as a basis for systematic revisions and for comparing diversity across taxa, but it is less appreciated that they also provide a means for statistical sampling of biodiversity databases. I assessed the completeness of molluscan species listings in the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) by comparing it to a standardized inventory of the species represented in the Malacology collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP). Random samples of names were scored for presence or absence in WoRMS, with standard errors calculated from the binomial distribution. The WoRMS database has about 1,200 duplicate or extraneous listings for mollusk species and is missing about 1,300 (3\%). Overall marine molluscan diversity is estimated at 43,600 $\pm$ 900 species, where 900 is a 95\% confidence interval. The validity of this confidence interval depends on the WoRMS database and the ANSP collection not having correlated weaknesses. Lack of relatively complete species databases prevents similar assessments for terrestrial and freshwater mollusks, but, using less rigorous methods, I estimate that there are 70,000 to 76,000 described species of recent Mollusca. The low end of this estimate, 70,000 species, is similar to the number of recent chordate species, 69,000, so it is possible that the Mollusca are not the second most diverse phylum of animals in terms of recognized recent species. Naming rates for chordate are currently higher than for mollusk, 750 versus 600 species per year, although the Mollusca are regarded as having higher undescribed diversity. The Mollusca have long been considered the most species-rich marine phylum, but the estimate of 43,600 is substantially below the 56,000 species of Arthropoda listed in WoRMS. Globally, the ratio of marine gastropod to marine bivalve species in WoRMS is 4:1, which is higher than in any regional fauna, suggesting that gastropods have smaller geographic ranges on average than bivalves. The main remaining gaps in WoRMS are among opisthobranchs (8\% missing) and Indo-Pacific marine mollusks (6\%). The most diverse molluscan genus in WoRMS is Turbonilla, with more than 1,000 species listed as accepted.},

At this time the numerous spikes on an almost flat base line generated by the brain when alert are replaced by slow waves of 15\textendash{}20Hz. In this work, we conducted experiments to determine the temporal relationship between the lying on one side position and the brain slow waves. We videotaped chronically implanted animals to detect their body position and simultaneously recorded their brain electrical activity. To analyze brain electrical activity, we developed a wavelet based method and correlated the results with body position. Among results are: (a) during sleep signals in the frequency range 30\textendash{}45Hz show a large decrease in power; (b) sleep slow waves are generated 1\textendash{}2min after the animal lies on one side and are maintained throughout the whole period in such position. We conclude that the strong correlation between brain slow waves and lying on one side position further indicates periods of true sleep in these animals.},

To study the temporal organization of such activity, we developed a tethered crayfish preparation that allows us to place electrodes on visually identified regions of the brain. Recording the electrical activity of different brain areas shows that when the animal is active (awake), slow waves are present only in the central complex. However, simultaneously with the animal becoming limp (sleeping), slow waves spread first to deuto- and then to protocerebrum, suggesting that the central complex of the crayfish brain acts as the sleep generator.},

Defined as a distinct state of reduced activity, arousability, attention, and initiative, it is well established in mammals, birds, reptiles, and teleosts. It is commonly defined by additional electroencephalographic criteria that are only well established in mammals and to some extent in birds. Sleep states similar to those in mammals, except for electrical criteria, seem to occur in some invertebrates, based on behavior and some physiological observations. Currently the most compelling evidence for sleep in invertebrates (evidence that meets most standard criteria for sleep) has been obtained in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. However, in mammals, sleep is also characterized by a brain state different from that at rest but awake. The electrophysiological slow wave criterion for this state is not seen in Drosophila or in honey bees. Here, we show that, in crayfish, a behavioral state with elevated threshold for vibratory stimulation is accompanied by a distinctive form of slow wave electrical activity of the brain, quite different from that during waking rest. Therefore, crayfish can attain a sleep state comparable to that of mammals.},

Research in zebrafish has also revealed interactions between melatonin and the hypocretin/orexin system, another important sleep-wake modulator. Future investigations should benefit from the conservation in zebrafish of mechanisms that regulate normal sleep, our extensive knowledge of their molecular biology, the availability of multiple transgenic and mutant phenotypes, and the feasibility of applying sensitive in vivo imaging techniques to record sleep-related neuronal activity in these optically transparent subjects. The established sensitivity of zebrafish to many pharmacological hypnotics should also contribute to the development of new, safe and effective sleep medications.},

Furthermore, our data show that the sleep-like state in zebrafish has fundamental similarities with sleep in mammals, including characteristic postures, elevated arousal threshold to sensory stimulation and a compensatory rest rebound following rest deprivation, and can be induced by conventional hypnotics, diazepam and sodium pentobarbital. Collectively, these data indicate that melatonin is evolutionary conserved sleep-promoting agent in diurnal species and suggest that zebrafish provide an efficient animal model for studying the molecular mechanisms of sleep regulation and for screening new types of hypnotic medications.},

Both species exhibited a clear rest-activity rhythm with activity predominating during the light period (Figs. 1, 2). `Rest deprivation' was carried out in perch during the habitual dim period by exposing the animals to either 12 h continuous light or to 6 h intermittent light (1 h light \textemdash{} 1 h dim for 12 h). Both light schedules enhanced activity and reduced rest (Fig. 3). Light-induced activation was followed by an increase in low activity and rest behavior which prevailed for 12 h following continuous light, and for 6 h following intermittent light (Figs. 3, 4). The results indicate that homeostatic mechanisms are involved in the regulation of rest and activity in fish. These mechanisms may be similar to those underlying sleep regulation in mammals.},

Sensitivity of this fish to hypnotic agents helps in designing high throughput screens for new hypnotic medications, evaluation of their efficacy, and potential side effects. The optical transparency of larval zebrafish and intracellular fluorescent markers of calcium responses available make it possible to visualize neuronal activity with single cell resolution in a behaving fish.

The discovery of an additional, almost-complete set of Hox clusters in teleosts (zebrafish, pufferfish, medaka, and cichlid) but not in basal actinopterygian lineages (Polypterus) led to the formulation of the fish-specific genome duplication hypothesis. The phylogenetic timing of this genome duplication during the evolution of ray-finned fish is unknown, since only a few species of basal fish lineages have been investigated so far. In this study, three nuclear genes (fzd8, sox11, tyrosinase) were sequenced from sturgeons (Acipenseriformes), gars (Semionotiformes), bony tongues (Osteoglossomorpha), and a tenpounder (Elopomorpha). For these three genes, two copies have been described previously teleosts (e.g., zebrafish, pufferfish), but only one orthologous copy is found in tetrapods. Individual gene trees for these three genes and a concatenated dataset support the hypothesis that the fish-specific genome duplication event took place after the split of the Acipenseriformes and the Semionotiformes from the lineage leading to teleost fish but before the divergence of Osteoglossiformes. If these three genes were duplicated during the proposed fish-specific genome duplication event, then this event separates the species-poor early-branching lineages from the species-rich teleost lineage. The additional number of genes resulting from this event might have facilitated the evolutionary radiation and the phenotypic diversification of the teleost fish.},

  abstract = {The cytokine hormone leptin is a key signalling molecule in many pathways that control physiological functions. Although leptin demonstrates structural conservation in mammals, there is evidence of positive selection in primates, lagomorphs and chiropterans. We previously reported that the leptin genes of the grey and harbour seals (phocids) have significantly diverged from other mammals. Therefore we further investigated the diversification of leptin in phocids, other marine mammals and terrestrial taxa by sequencing the leptin genes of representative species. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that leptin diversification was pronounced within the phocid seals with a high dN/dS ratio of 2.8, indicating positive selection. We found significant evidence of positive selection along the branch leading to the phocids, within the phocid clade, but not over the dataset as a whole. Structural predictions indicate that the individual residues under selection are away from the leptin receptor (LEPR) binding site. Predictions of the surface electrostatic potential indicate that phocid seal leptin is notably different to other mammalian leptins, including the otariids. Cloning the grey seal leptin binding domain of LEPR confirmed that this was structurally conserved. These data, viewed in toto, support a hypothesis that phocid leptin divergence is unlikely to have arisen by random mutation. Based upon these phylogenetic and structural assessments, and considering the comparative physiology and varying life histories among species, we postulate that the unique phocid diving behaviour has produced this selection pressure. The Phocidae includes some of the deepest diving species, yet have the least modified lung structure to cope with pressure and volume changes experienced at depth. Therefore, greater surfactant production is required to facilitate rapid lung re-inflation upon surfacing, while maintaining patent airways. We suggest that this additional surfactant requirement is met by the leptin pulmonary surfactant production pathway which normally appears only to function in the mammalian foetus.},

It is commonly assumed that flying birds maintain environmental awareness and aerodynamic control by sleeping with only one eye closed and one cerebral hemisphere at a time. However, sleep has never been demonstrated in flying birds. Here, using electroencephalogram recordings of great frigatebirds (Fregata minor) flying over the ocean for up to 10 days, we show that they can sleep with either one hemisphere at a time or both hemispheres simultaneously. Also unexpectedly, frigatebirds sleep for only 0.69 h d-1 (7.4\% of the time spent sleeping on land), indicating that ecological demands for attention usually exceed the attention afforded by sleeping unihemispherically. In addition to establishing that birds can sleep in flight, our results challenge the view that they sustain prolonged flights by obtaining normal amounts of sleep on the wing.},

  abstract = {Lifestyles involving sleep deprivation are common, despite mounting evidence that both acute total sleep deprivation and chronically restricted sleep degrade neurobehavioral functions associated with arousal, attention, memory and state stability. Current research suggests dynamic differences in the way the central nervous system responds to acute versus chronic sleep restriction, which is reflected in new models of sleep-wake regulation. Chronic sleep restriction likely induces long-term neuromodulatory changes in brain physiology that could explain why recovery from it may require more time than from acute sleep loss. High intraclass correlations in neurobehavioral responses to sleep loss suggest that these trait-like differences are phenotypic and may include genetic components. Sleep deprivation induces changes in brain metabolism and neural activation that involve distributed networks and connectivity.},

  abstract = {Birds are the only taxonomic group other than mammals that exhibit high-amplitude slow-waves in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep. This defining feature of slow-wave sleep (SWS) apparently evolved independently in mammals and birds, as reptiles do not exhibit similar EEG activity during sleep. In mammals, the level of slow-wave activity (SWA) (low-frequency spectral power density) during SWS increases and decreases as a function of prior time spent awake and asleep, respectively, and therefore reflects homeostatically regulated sleep processes potentially tied to the function of SWS. Although birds also exhibit SWS, previous sleep deprivation studies in birds did not detect a compensatory increase in SWS-related SWA during recovery, as observed in similarly sleep-deprived mammals. This suggested that, unlike mammalian SWS, avian SWS is not homeostatically regulated, and therefore might serve a different function. However, we recently demonstrated that SWA during SWS increases in pigeons following short-term sleep deprivation. Herein we summarize research on avian sleep homeostasis, and cast our evidence for this phenomenon within the context of theories for the function of SWS in mammals. We propose that the convergent evolution of homeostatically regulated SWS in mammals and birds was directly linked to the convergent evolution of large, heavily interconnected brains capable of performing complex cognitive processes in each group. Specifically, as has been proposed for mammals, the interconnectivity that forms the basis of complex cognition in birds may also instantiate slow, synchronous network oscillations during SWS that in turn maintain interconnectivity and cognition at an optimal level.},

Among mammals, unihemispheric sleep is restricted to aquatic species (Cetaceans, eared seals and manatees). In contrast to mammals, unihemispheric sleep is widespread in birds, and may even occur in reptiles. Unihemispheric sleep allows surfacing to breathe in aquatic mammals and predator detection in birds. Despite the apparent utility in being able to sleep unihemispherically, very few mammals sleep in this manner. This is particularly interesting since the reptilian ancestors to mammals may have slept unihemispherically. The relative absence of unihemispheric sleep in mammals suggests that a trade off exists between unihemispheric sleep and other adaptive brain functions occurring during sleep or wakefulness. Presumably, the benefits of sleeping unihemispherically only outweigh the costs under extreme circumstances such as sleeping at sea. Ultimately, a greater understanding of the reasons for little unihemispheric sleep in mammals promises to provide insight into the functions of sleep, in general.},

The presence of changes in slow wave activity was determined from the power spectra of the EEG. Spectral power density in the 0.5\textendash{}4.0 Hz band during slow wave sleep (SWS) attained highest values in the first part of the night, then declined. This trend in EEG spectra, which occurred across the night, probably reflects a homeostatic process strikingly similar to that observed in mammals. The reactivity to natural calls during SWS episodes also decreased across the night. Episodes of interhemispheric EEG asymmetry, which typically lasted from 2 to 4 s, occurred when birds displayed the front sleep posture and they constituted 140\textendash{}200 s of each night. Unihemispheric sleep episodes probably result from unilateral activation of the visual system, and they could be considered as an evolutionary adaptation. HR was highest in wakefulness and lower in sleep but, due to large variability, reliable discrimination between sleep and wakefulness could not be made. Comparison of the blackbird's behavior during 4 different nights revealed a strong effect of the first night on sleeping behavior. A significant reduction in back sleep posture occurred during the baseline night, when lead wires were connected.},

Here, we show that male pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos), a polygynous Arctic breeding shorebird, are able to maintain high neurobehavioral performance despite greatly reducing their time spent sleeping during a 3-week period of intense male-male competition for access to fertile females. Males that slept the least sired the most offspring. Our results challenge the view that decreased performance is an inescapable outcome of sleep loss.

 in Diptera by Jerry Hirsch and coworkers. Three quantitative-genetic
 insights derived from these latter studies serve as guiding principles
 for the former. First, interacting polygenes underlie complex traits.
 Consequently, learning/memory defects associated with single-gene
 mutants can be quantified accurately only in equilibrated,
 heterogeneous genetic backgrounds. Second, complex behavioral responses
 will be composed of genetically distinct functional components. Thus,
 genetic dissection of complex traits into specific biobehavioral
 properties is likely. Finally, disruptions of genes involved with
 learning/memory are likely to have pleiotropic effects. As a result,
 task-relevant sensorimotor responses required for normal learning must
 be assessed carefully to interpret performance in learning/memory
 experiments. In addition, more specific conclusions will be obtained
 from reverse-genetic experiments, in which gene disruptions are
 restricted in time and/or space.},

  abstract = {Over half of all described species are insects, but until recently our understanding of the reasons for this diversity was based on very little macroevolutionary evidence. Here I summarize the hypotheses that have been posed, tests of these hypotheses and their results, and hence identify gaps in knowledge for future researchers to pursue. I focus on inferences from the following sources: (i) the fossil record, normally at family level, and (ii) insect phylogenies, sometimes combined with: (iii) the species richness of insect higher taxa, and (iv) current extinction risks. There is evidence that the species richness of insects has been enhanced by: (i) their relative age, giving time for diversification to take place; (ii) low extinction rates. There is little evidence that rates of origination have generally been high or that there are limits on numbers of species. However, the evidence on macroevolutionary rates is not yet so extensive or coherent as to present unequivocal messages. As regards morphological, ecological, or behavioural hypotheses, there is evidence that diversity has been enhanced by (iii) flight or properties resulting from it like enhanced dispersal, (iv) wing folding, and (v) complete metamorphosis. However, in all these cases the evidence is somewhat equivocal, either because of statistical issues or because evidence from different sources is conflicting. There is extensive evidence that diversity is affected by (vi) the ecological niche. Comparative studies indicate that phytophagy generally increases net diversification rates, and reduces extinction risk. However, niche specialization is also associated with an increase in extinction risk. Small body size (vii) is often associated with low extinction risk in comparative studies, but as yet there is no solid evidence that it consistently enhances net rates of diversification. Mouthpart diversity (viii) has generally increased over time in the insects, but cannot explain the apparent great increase in diversity seen in the Cretaceous and Tertiary. Sexual selection and sexual conflict (ix) are two processes that are widespread in insects, and there is comparative evidence linking both to increased diversification. Although some comparative evidence links tropical distributions (x) to increased rates of diversification, the extent to which latitudinal richness gradients are unusual in insects is equivocal. There is little to no direct evidence from fossils and phylogenies that insect diversity has generally been affected by (i) sensory- or neuro-sophistication, (ii) population size or density, (iii) generation time or fecundity, (iv) the presence of an exoskeleton or cuticle, (v) segmentation or appendage diversity, (vi) adaptability or genetic versatility, though all of these remain plausible hypotheses awaiting further tests. The data suggest that the insect body ground plan itself had no direct effect on insect diversity. Thus, whilst studies to date have given substantial understanding, substantial gaps still remain. Future challenges include: (i) interpreting conflicting messages from different sources of data; (ii) rating the importance of different hypotheses that are statistically supported; (iii) linking specific proximate to specific ultimate explanations and vice versa; and (iv) understanding how different ultimate hypotheses might be dependent on each other.},

Furthermore, third instar larvae of both species preferred more alkaline substrates.

Both activities exert inducing and polarizing effects on the pattern when transplanted to other egg regions. A small set of maternal genes have been identified that are required for these activities. Mutants in these genes lack either the anterior or posterior part of the segmented pattern. The unsegmented terminal embryonic regions require a third class of genes and form independently of the anterior and posterior centers.},

  volume = {312},
  issn = {0028-0836},
  abstract = {The per locus of Drosophila melanogaster has a fundamental role in the construction or maintenance of a biological clock. Three classes of per mutations have been identified: per mutants have circadian behavioural rhythms with a 29-h rather than a 24-h period, pers mutants have short-period rhythms of 19 h, and per mutants have no detectable circadian rhythms. Each of these mutations has a corresponding influence on the 55-s periodicity of male courtship song. Long- and short-period circadian rhythm phenotypes can also be obtained by altering the dosage of the wild-type gene: for example, females carrying only one dose of this X-linked gene have circadian rhythms with periodicities about 1 h longer than those carrying two doses. In a previous report, cloned DNA was used to localize several chromosomal rearrangement breakpoints that alter per locus function. The rearrangements all affected a 7-kilobase (kb) interval that encodes a 4.5-kb poly(A)+ RNA. We report here that when a 7.1-kb fragment from a per+ fly, including the sequences encoding the 4.5-kb transcript, is introduced into the genome of a per (arrhythmic) fly by P element-mediated transformation, circadian rhythmicity of behaviour such as eclosion and locomotor activity is restored. The transforming DNA complements per locus deletions and is transcribed, forming a single 4.5-kb poly(A)+ RNA comparable to that produced by wild-type flies.},

The trees obtained by these methods revealed four main lineages or clades which do not correspond to the taxonomical hierarchy. In our results, the genus Chymomyza is associated with the subgenus Scaptodrosophila of the genus Drosophila and their cluster constitutes the most ancient clade. The two other clades are constituted of groups belonging to the subgenus Sophophora of the genus Drosophila: the so-called Neotropical clade including the willistoni and saltans groups and the obscura-melanogaster clade itself split into three lineages: (1) obscura group + ananassae subgroup, (2) montium subgroup, and (3) melanogaster + Oriental subgroups. The fourth clade, the Drosophila one, contains three lineages. D. polychaeta, D. iri, and D. fraburu are branched together and constitute the most ancient lineage; the second lineage includes the annulimana, bromeliae, dreyfusi, melanica, mesophragmatica, repleta, robusta, and virilis groups. The third lineage is composed of the immigrans and the cardini, funebris, guaramunu, guarani, histrio, pallidipennis, quinaria, and tripunctata groups. The genera Samoaia, Scaptomyza, and Zaprionus are branched within the Drosophila clade.

  abstract = {Nearly all studies of Drosophila melanogaster courtship have focused exclusively on male behaviour. Female precopulatory behaviour is often relegated to `accept' or `reject' mating, and how female behaviour interacts with that of males remains largely unknown. Using a video-computing approach, we measured 10 behavioural states and 22 elementary behaviours that occur during the precopulatory phase of Canton-S (Cs) flies. Male and female behaviours were studied under a variety of social conditions. This allowed us to identify which one(s) is relevant to courtship or to general activity. Our analysis showed that the courtship repertoire was not constant over time, as female and male behaviours varied during courtship, and that virgin Cs females showed several behavioural sequences whose frequency, latency and total duration could predict their mating success. The most striking index of females' willingness to copulate was the way they extruded the ovipositor: a partial extrusion stimulated male courtship, whereas total extrusion inhibited it. Furthermore, females that mated preened their abdomen more frequently than did females that did not mate. We also observed that male sexual activity was strongly increased when the female emitted a tiny volatile droplet at the tip of the ovipositor. We hypothesized that partial ovipositor extrusion, droplet emission and abdominal preening are related behaviours that result in the active dispersion of compounds spread on the female's abdomen. Such a detailed picture of the precopulatory behaviours should allow better characterization of the sensory stimuli exchanged during courtship in Drosophila.},

Yet how to effectively analyse such behavioural data remains an open question. Here, we explore whether a minimum description length principle can be exploited to identify meaningful behaviours and phenotypes. We apply a dictionary compression algorithm to behavioural sequences from the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans freely crawling on an agar plate both with and without food and during chemotaxis. We find that the motifs identified by the compression algorithm are rare but relevant for comparisons between worms in different environments, suggesting that hierarchical compression can be a useful step in behaviour analysis. We also use compressibility as a new quantitative phenotype and find that the behaviour of wild-isolated strains of C. elegans is more compressible than that of the laboratory strain N2 as well as the majority of mutant strains examined. Importantly, in distinction to more conventional phenotypes such as overall motor activity or aggregation behaviour, the increased compressibility of wild isolates is not explained by the loss of function of the gene npr-1, which suggests that erratic locomotion is a laboratory-derived trait with a novel genetic basis. Because hierarchical compression can be applied to any sequence, we anticipate that compressibility can offer insights into the organization of behaviour in other animals including humans.},

Here, we use a recently developed unsupervised technique to discover and track the occurrence of all stereotyped behaviors performed by fruit flies moving in a shallow arena. Calculating the optimally predictive representation of the fly's future behaviors, we show that fly behavior exhibits multiple time scales and is organized into a hierarchical structure that is indicative of its underlying behavioral programs and its changing internal states.},

Results indicate that the Lomb\textendash{}Scargle algorithm shows a clearly better detection efficiency and accuracy in the presence of noise, and avoids possible bias or erroneous results that may arise from replacement of missing data by interpolation techniques. Hence, the Lomb\textendash{}Scargle periodogram may serve as a useful method for the study of biological rhythms, especially when applied to telemetrical or observational time-series obtained from free-living animals, i.e., data sets that notoriously lack points.},

We show that even for relatively short (10 day) time series, the integral-valued chi-square periodogram can distinguish circadian-periodic from random series at a level of significance of about 0$\cdot$01. In addition, we describe the effects of serial correlation and examine the resolving power of the method for two periodic components in the circadian range. We suggest how the method can be most profitably employed in the analysis of event-recorder data for detection of rhythmicity in the range 14 to 34 h., and for the estimation of period to $\pm$0$\cdot$2 h.},

Therefore, it was surprising when studies of circadian rhythmic behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila suggested that the normal operations of circadian clock cells, which house the molecular oscillator, in fact depend on non-cell-autonomous effects - interactions between the clock cells themselves. Here we review several genetic analyses that broadly extend that viewpoint. They support a model whereby the approximately 150 circadian clock cells in the brain of the fly are sub-divided into functionally discrete rhythmic centers. These centers alternatively cooperate or compete to control the different episodes of rhythmic behavior that define the fly's daily activity profile.},

The identification of these factors is facilitated by recent innovations in high-throughput screening. However, large-scale screening in whole organisms remains challenging, in particular when studying changes in brain function or behavior in vertebrate model systems. In this study, we present a novel imaging system for high-throughput analyses of behavior in zebrafish larvae. The three-camera system can image 12 multiwell plates simultaneously and is unique in its ability to provide local visual stimuli in the wells of a multiwell plate. The acquired images are converted into a series of coordinates, which characterize the location and orientation of the larvae. The developed imaging techniques were tested by measuring avoidance behaviors in seven-day-old zebrafish larvae. The system effectively quantified larval avoidance and revealed an increased edge preference in response to a blue or red `bouncing ball' stimulus. Larvae also avoid a bouncing ball stimulus when it is counter-balanced with a stationary ball, but do not avoid blinking balls counter-balanced with a stationary ball. These results indicate that the seven-day-old larvae respond specifically to movement, rather than color, size, or local changes in light intensity. The imaging system and assays for measuring avoidance behavior may be used to screen for genetic and environmental factors that cause developmental brain disorders and for novel drugs that could prevent or treat these disorders.},

Furthermore, FLIC experiments can persist indefinitely without disturbance, and we highlight this ability by establishing a detailed picture of circadian feeding behaviors in the fly.

The versatility and attractiveness of the wavelet approach lie in its decomposition properties, principally its time-scale localization. It is especially relevant to the analysis of non-stationary systems, i.e., systems with short-lived transient components, like those observed in ecological systems. Here, we review the basic properties of the wavelet approach for time-series analysis from an ecological perspective. Wavelet decomposition offers several advantages that are discussed in this paper and illustrated by appropriate synthetic and ecological examples. Wavelet analysis is notably free from the assumption of stationarity that makes most methods unsuitable for many ecological time series. Wavelet analysis also permits analysis of the relationships between two signals, and it is especially appropriate for following gradual change in forcing by exogenous variables.},

The latter possesses a myriad of oscillatory modes from interannual (2\textendash{}5 yr), interdecadal (10\textendash{}12 yr, 20\textendash{}25 yr, and 40\textendash{}60 yr), and century (\textasciitilde{}180 yr) scales at different periods of the data record.

Here we review 1) advances in imaging and computer vision that are making it possible to capture increasingly complete records of animal motion and 2) new approaches to understanding the resulting behavioural data sets. With the right analytical approaches, these data are allowing researchers to revisit longstanding questions about the structure and organisation of animal behaviour and to put unifying principles on a quantitative footing. Contributions from both experimentalists and theorists are leading to the emergence of a physics of behaviour and the prospect of discovering laws and developing theories with broad applicability. We believe that there now exists an opportunity to develop theories of behaviour which can be tested using these data sets leading to a deeper understanding of how and why animals behave.},

periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data

periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of

  abstract = {We review time-frequency methods that can be useful in quantifying circadian and ultradian patterns in behavioral records. These records typically exhibit details that may not be captured through commonly used measures such as activity onset and so may require alternative approaches. For instance, activity may involve multiple bouts that vary in duration and magnitude within a day, or may exhibit day-to-day changes in period and in ultradian activity patterns. The discrete Fourier transform and other types of periodograms can estimate the period of a circadian rhythm, but we show that they can fail to correctly assess ultradian periods. In addition, such methods cannot detect changes in the period over time. Time-frequency methods that can localize frequency estimates in time are more appropriate for analysis of ultradian periods and of fluctuations in the period. The continuous wavelet transform offers a method for determining instantaneous frequency with good resolution in both time and frequency, capable of detecting changes in circadian period over the course of several days and in ultradian period within a given day. The discrete wavelet transform decomposes a time series into components associated with distinct frequency bands, thereby facilitating the removal of noise and trend or the isolation of a particular frequency band of interest. To demonstrate the wavelet-based analysis, we apply the transforms to a numerically-generated example and also to a variety of hamster behavioral records. When used appropriately, wavelet transforms can reveal patterns that are not easily extracted using other methods of analysis in common use, but they must be applied and interpreted with care.},

  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0034784},
  abstract = {Background In recent years, there have been extensive studies aimed at decoding the DNA. Identifying the genetic cause of specific changes in a simple organism like Drosophila may help scientists recognize how multiple gene interactions may make some people more susceptible to heart disease or cancer. Investigators have devised experiments to observe changes in the gene networks in mutant Drosophila that responds differently to light, or have lower or higher locomotor activity. However, these studies focused on the behavior of the individual fly or on pair-wise interactions in the study of aggression or courtship. The behavior of these activities has been captured on film and inspected by a well-trained researcher after repeatedly watching the recorded film. Some studies also focused on ways to reduce the inspection time and increase the accuracy of the behavior experiment. Methodology In this study, the behavior of drosophila during courtship was analyzed automatically by machine vision. We investigated the position and behavior discrimination during courtship using the captured images. Identification of the characteristics of drosophila, including sex, size, heading direction, and wing angles, can be computed using image analysis techniques that employ the Gaussian mixture model. The behavior of multiple drosophilae can also be analyzed simultaneously using the motion-prediction model and the variation constraint of heading direction. Conclusions The overlapped fruit flies can be identified based on the relationship between body centers. Moreover, the behaviors and profiles can be correctly recognized by image processing based on the constraints of the wing angle and the size of the body. Therefore, the behavior of the male fruit flies can be discriminated when two or three fruit flies form a close cluster. In this study, the courtship behavior, including wing songs and attempts, can currently be distinguished with accuracies of 95.8\% and 90\%, respectively.},

Despite increasing reliance on computing in every domain of scientific endeavor, the computer source code critical to understanding and evaluating computer programs is commonly withheld, effectively rendering these programs ``black boxes'' in the research work flow. Exempting from basic publication and disclosure standards such a ubiquitous category of research tool carries substantial negative consequences. Eliminating this disparity will require concerted policy action by funding agencies and journal publishers, as well as changes in the way research institutions receiving public funds manage their intellectual property (IP).

From videos of 400,000 flies, we quantified the behavioral effects of activating 2,204 genetically targeted populations of neurons. We combined a novel quantification of anatomy with our behavioral analysis to create brain-behavior correlation maps, which are shared as browsable web pages and interactive software. Based on these maps, we generated hypotheses of regions of the brain causally related to sensory processing, locomotor control, courtship, aggression, and sleep. Our maps directly specify genetic tools to target these regions, which we used to identify a small population of neurons with a role in the control of walking.$<$/p$>$},

This article extends the literature by studying journal data sharing policies by year (for both 2011 and 2012) for a referent set of 170 journals. We make a further contribution by evaluating code sharing policies, supplemental materials policies, and open access status for these 170 journals for each of 2011 and 2012. We build a predictive model of open data and code policy adoption as a function of impact factor and publisher and find higher impact journals more likely to have open data and code policies and scientific societies more likely to have open data and code policies than commercial publishers. We also find open data policies tend to lead open code policies, and we find no relationship between open data and code policies and either supplemental material policies or open access journal status. Of the journals in this study, 38\% had a data policy, 22\% had a code policy, and 66\% had a supplemental materials policy as of June 2012. This reflects a striking one year increase of 16\% in the number of data policies, a 30\% increase in code policies, and a 7\% increase in the number of supplemental materials policies.

However, a major drawback to these techniques has been their reliance on dimensionality reduction of images which destroys information about which parts of the body are used in each behavior. To address this issue, we introduce a deep learning-based method for pose estimation, LEAP (LEAP Estimates Animal Pose). LEAP automatically predicts the positions of animal body parts using a deep convolutional neural network with as little as 10 frames of labeled data for training. This framework consists of a graphical interface for interactive labeling of body parts and software for training the network and fast prediction on new data (1 hr to train, 185 Hz predictions). We validate LEAP using videos of freely behaving fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and track 32 distinct points on the body to fully describe the pose of the head, body, wings, and legs with an error rate of $<$3\% of the animal's body length. We recapitulate a number of reported findings on insect gait dynamics and show LEAP's applicability as the first step in unsupervised behavioral classification. Finally, we extend the method to more challenging imaging situations (pairs of flies moving on a mesh-like background) and movies from freely moving mice (Mus musculus) where we track the full conformation of the head, body, and limbs.},

  abstract = {Modern neuroscience and the interest in biomimetic control design demand increasingly sophisticated experimental techniques that can be applied in freely moving animals under realistic behavioral conditions. To explore sensorimotor flight control mechanisms in free-flying fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), we equipped a wind tunnel with a Virtual Reality (VR) display system based on standard digital hardware and a 3D path tracking system. We demonstrate the experimental power of this approach by example of a `one-parameter open loop' testing paradigm. It provided (1) a straightforward measure of transient responses in presence of open loop visual stimulation; (2) high data throughput and standardized measurement conditions from process automation; and (3) simplified data analysis due to well-defined testing conditions. Being based on standard hardware and software techniques, our methods provide an affordable, easy to replicate and general solution for a broad range of behavioral applications in freely moving animals. Particular relevance for advanced behavioral research tools originates from the need to perform detailed behavioral analyses in genetically modified organisms and animal models for disease research.},

Flies exhibit extraordinary maneuverability, relying on feedback from multiple sensory organs to control flight. Both the compound eyes and the mechanosensory halteres encode angular motion as the fly rotates about the three body axes during flight. Since these two sensory modalities differ in their mechanisms of transduction, they are likely to differ in their temporal responses. We recorded changes in stroke kinematics in response to mechanical and visual rotations delivered within a flight simulator. Our results show that the visual system is tuned to relatively slow rotation whereas the haltere-mediated response to mechanical rotation increases with rising angular velocity. The integration of feedback from these two modalities may enhance aerodynamic performance by enabling the fly to sense a wide range of angular velocities during flight.},

Animals must quickly recognize objects in their environment and act accordingly. Previous studies indicate that looming visual objects trigger avoidance reflexes in many species [1\textendash{}5]; however, such reflexes operate over a close range and might not detect a threatening stimulus at a safe distance. We analyzed how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) respond to simple visual stimuli both in free flight and in a tethered-flight simulator. Whereas Drosophila, like many other insects, are attracted toward long vertical objects [6\textendash{}10], we found that smaller visual stimuli elicit not weak attraction but rather strong repulsion. Because aversion to small spots depends on the vertical size of a moving object, and not on looming, it can function at a much greater distance than expansion-dependent reflexes. The opposing responses to long stripes and small spots reflect a simple but effective object classification system. Attraction toward long stripes would lead flies toward vegetative perches or feeding sites, whereas repulsion from small spots would help them avoid aerial predators or collisions with other insects. The motion of flying Drosophila depends on a balance of these two systems, providing a foundation for studying the neural basis of behavioral choice in a genetic model organism.},

Tethered flight in a 3-day-old female Drosophila was sustained for 32.2 h with only short interruptions during uptake of sucrose solution. The course-control reactions derived from the difference of the wingbeat amplitudes on either side have been used to simulate the rotatory displacement of the surrounding landmarks during a comparable turn in free flight. Stabilization of a target in the preferred area of the visual field requires continuous visual attention. A rate of about 5 course-correcting manoeuvres per second was maintained throughout the experiment. Drosophila seems to be able to cover long distances in search of a favourable habitat.
Flight-specific carbohydrate consumption is equivalent to a metabolic power input per body weight of about 18 W N-1. The tethered fly produces about 40 \% of the lift required to sustain hovering flight. The resulting mechanochemical efficiency of about 0.04-0.07 is within the expected order of magnitude for flying insects. Expenditure of reserve substances may account for the difference between the comparatively low power input of about 7 WN-1 derived from carbohydrate uptake in the first hours of flight (Wigglesworth, 1949), and the actual metabolic turnover of about 21WN-1 derived from oxygen consumption during this period (Laurie-Ahlberg et al. 1985).
Weis-Fogh's `clap and fling', a widespread lift-generating process exploiting the aerodynamic wing interference at the dorsal end of the wingbeat, was in action throughout the flight. However, there were two significant modifications (as first conceived by Ellington, 1980): (1) during `clap', there is a progress of wing contact from the leading to the trailing edge, which is likely to `squeeze' a thrust-generating jet of air to the rear; (2) during `fling', there is a progress of wing separation in the same direction, which is described as a `peel' resembling the progressive separation of two plastic foils pulled apart against forces of mutual attraction. The wings of the test fly survived about 23 million such peels without damage. Increasing airspeed decreases the intensity of `clap and fling' in Drosophila: results obtained in the wind tunnel show the transition to a `near clap and fling', lacking mutual wing contact.},

Flies move through their environment using a series of straight flight segments separated by rapid turns, termed saccades, during which the fly alters course by approximately 90$^\circ$ in less than 100\&nbsp;ms. Altering the amount of background visual contrast caused significant changes in the fly's translational velocity and saccade frequency. Between saccades, asymmetries in the estimates of optic flow induce gradual turns away from the side experiencing a greater motion stimulus, a behavior opposite to that predicted by a flight control model based upon optomotor equilibrium. To determine which features of visual motion trigger saccades, we reconstructed the visual environment from the fly's perspective for each position in the flight trajectory. From these reconstructions, we modeled the fly's estimation of optic flow on the basis of a two-dimensional array of Hassenstein\textendash{}Reichardt elementary motion detectors and, through spatial summation, the large-field motion stimuli experienced by the fly during the course of its flight. Event-triggered averages of the large-field motion preceding each saccade suggest that image expansion is the signal that triggers each saccade. The asymmetry in output of the local motion detector array prior to each saccade influences the direction (left \emph{versus} right) but not the magnitude of the rapid turn. Once initiated, visual feedback does not appear to influence saccade kinematics further. The total expansion experienced before a saccade was similar for flight within both uniform and visually textured backgrounds. In summary, our data suggest that complex behavioral patterns seen during free flight emerge from interactions between the flight control system and the visual environment.}$<$/p$>$},

Locomotor activity is monitored by a video-tracking paradigm. Multiple parameters are extracted to construct the portrait of locomotor activity: the total distance moved, the number of episodes of activity and inactivity, the duration of activity, and the mean walking speed. To initiate a quantification of the fly's spatial walking movements, the number of passages in a virtual centre zone has also been determined. Moreover, to reveal the trajectory, as an index of fly's navigation ability, the turning angle, the angular velocity and the meander have been measured. Finally, we show that the number of episodes of inactivity as function of their duration follows a power law, while its counterpart, the episodes of activity does not, suggesting that the overall pattern of locomotor activity adheres to a fractal-like structure. Remarkably, the majority of these parameters are sexually dimorphic. This fine description of locomotor activity represents a new tool which will facilitate the study of the role of the different brain structures in the organisation of locomotor activity and the localisation of the fly's central pattern generator for locomotion and its motivational control.},

FIM enables high throughput screening for even subtle behavioral phenotypes. We tested this newly developed setup by analyzing locomotion deficits caused by the glial knockdown of several genes.

Here, we describe a system capable of tracking the three-dimensional position and body orientation of animals such as flies and birds. The system operates with less than 40 ms latency and can track multiple animals simultaneously. To achieve these results, a multi-target tracking algorithm was developed based on the extended Kalman filter and the nearest neighbour standard filter data association algorithm. In one implementation, an 11-camera system is capable of tracking three flies simultaneously at 60 frames per second using a gigabit network of nine standard Intel Pentium 4 and Core 2 Duo computers. This manuscript presents the rationale and details of the algorithms employed and shows three implementations of the system. An experiment was performed using the tracking system to measure the effect of visual contrast on the flight speed of Drosophila melanogaster. At low contrasts, speed is more variable and faster on average than at high contrasts. Thus, the system is already a useful tool to study the neurobiology and behaviour of freely flying animals. If combined with other techniques, such as `virtual reality'-type computer graphics or genetic manipulation, the tracking system would offer a powerful new way to investigate the biology of flying animals.},

As optogenetic experiments become routine in certain fields of neuroscience research, creating even more specialized tools is imperative (see the Perspective by Hayashi). By engineering channelrhodopsin, Wietek et al. (p. 409, published online 27 March) and Berndt et al.

These new tools not only improve understanding of channelrhodopsins but also provide a way to silence cells.
A single nervous system can generate many distinct motor patterns. Identifying which neurons and circuits control which behaviors has been a laborious piecemeal process, usually for one observer-defined behavior at a time. We present a fundamentally different approach to neuron-behavior mapping. We optogenetically activated 1054 identified neuron lines in Drosophila larvae and tracked the behavioral responses from 37,780 animals. Application of multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data enabled us to identify 29 discrete, statistically distinguishable, observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.
An atlas is generated to reveal activation of which specific neurons in a Drosophila larva produce specific behaviors. [Also see Perspective by O'Leary and Marder]

Here we review the current state and discuss the future effect of accelerating advances in technology for behavioral studies, focusing on rodents as an example. We frame our perspective in three dimensions: the degree of experimental constraint, dimensionality of data and level of description. We argue that 'big behavioral data' presents challenges proportionate to its promise and describe how these challenges might be met through opportunities afforded by the two rival conceptual legacies of twentieth century behavioral science, ethology and psychology. We conclude that, although 'more is not necessarily better', copious, quantitative and open behavioral data has the potential to transform and unify these two disciplines and to solidify the foundations of others, including neuroscience, but only if the development of new theoretical frameworks and improved experimental designs matches the technological progress.},

To enable biologists to design experiments to obtain better behavioral measurements, and computer scientists to pinpoint fruitful directions for algorithm improvement, we review known effects of artificial manipulation of the animal on behavior.

These include multiple modes of locomotion and grooming.

Differences in larval locomotor behavior (``crawling behavior'') can be attributed to the second chromosome, the ``rover'' strategy being dominant over the ``sitter'' strategy. Differences in feeding rate (``shoveling behavior'') are affected additively by both the second and third chromosomes. Natural populations ofDrosophila larvae were sampled three times over a 2-month period; ``rovers'' and ``sitters'' were at constant frequencies in these populations.

  abstract = {A well-defined sleep deprivation (SD) syndrome has been observed in studies with rats under conditions of severe sleep loss on the Disk-Over-Water (DOW) apparatus. Observation of the sleep deprivation syndrome across taxa would assist in the elucidation of the function of sleep. In the present study, the effects of total sleep deprivation were assessed in pigeons, a biologically relevant choice given that birds are the only non-mammalian taxon known to exhibit unequivocal rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (NREM) sleep. Pigeons were deprived of sleep for 24\textendash{}29~days on the DOW by rotating the disk and requiring them to walk whenever sleep was initiated. Control (C) birds were also housed on the DOW and required to walk only when the deprived (D) birds were required to walk due to sleep initiation. NREM and REM sleep amounts were reduced from baseline during the deprivation for both D and C birds, although D birds obtained less NREM sleep than controls. Across the deprivation, D birds had their total sleep reduced by 54\% of baseline (scored in 4~s epochs), whereas previous studies in rats on the DOW reported total sleep reduction of as much as 91\% (scored in 30~s epochs). Pigeons proved to be more resistant to sleep deprivation by the DOW method and were much more difficult to deprive over the course of the experiment. Overall, the pigeons showed recovery sleep patterns similar to those seen in rats; i.e., rebound sleep during recovery was disproportionately composed of REM sleep. They did not, however, show the obvious external physical signs of the SD syndrome nor the large metabolic and thermoregulatory changes associated with the syndrome. The DOW method was thus effective in producing sleep loss in the pigeon, but was not as effective as it is in rats. The absence of the full SD syndrome is discussed in the context of limitations of the DOW apparatus and the possibility of species-specific adaptations that birds may possess to withstand or adapt to conditions of limited sleep opportunity.},

At 2 hr, 68 per cent were either torpid or paralysed, at 20 hr, 83 per cent were paralysed. Weight loss was a distinct physiological symptom of stress paralysis: The calculated mean loss was 9$\cdot$5 mg/hr for torpid insects and 12$\cdot$4 mg/hr for paralysed cockroaches, losses were four to six times larger than those occurring in starved cockroaches. However, the haemolymph osrnolarities of the three categories showed no appreciable differences. Only starved and paralysed cockroaches showed a noticeable reduction in muscle fibre membrane potentials of the flexor tibia\textemdash{}a mean value below 40 mV for starved insects and a mean value below 50 mV for paralysed insects. Both of these categories consistently showed a lower amplitude for junctional potentials, but paralysed cockroaches showed a much higher incidence of complete failure to neural stimulation. Most muscle fibres of completely paralysed insects lost their sensitivity to direct extracellular stimulation while the loss in sensitivity was less evident in starved cockroaches. Axonal conduction on the crural nerve was not changed by stress, and the spontaneous efferent activity of completely paralysed insects was similar to the pattern of activity for normal cockroaches. Stress seemed to alter the volume and content of the intermyofibral spaces of muscles.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: For more than 1500 years, the status of knowledge concerning the physiology of human respiration has remained almost unchanged. In the 18th century, the French chemist Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier conducted breathing experiments on human and animal respiration.
METHODS: The main bibliographic sources concerning Lavoisier's life and work on respiration have been investigated and analysed.
RESULTS: Using an ice-calorimeter, Lavoisier proved that combustion and respiration were one and the same. He also measured the oxygen consumed during respiration and concluded that the amount changes depending on human activities: exercise, eating, fasting, and sitting in a warm or cold room. Moreover, he found variations in pulse and breathing rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Lavoisier's work on respiration is of great historical significance as it represents the first effort to measure human respiratory gas metabolism contributing significantly to the development of respiratory physiology.},

Sleep was also used as a method of healing in special sleep temples, designed for dream incubation. Early mentioning of sleep disorders and their treatment could be found in the few survived papyri dealing with the ancient Egyptian medicine. The first hypnotic medication in history was prescribed by the Egyptians, who used poppy seeds (opium) to treat insomnia, headache, and as an anesthetic.},

  abstract = {In the theoretical part of the present work the input-output relation for a multi-input system is developed into a functional power series. This is formally equivalent to a decomposition of the system into a sum of all possible combinations of 1-, 2-, 3-... input subsystems. The average response of the system to a uniformly moving patern is known to be a Fourier series with respect to spatial frequency. The coefficients of the series are linear combinations of the ``weights'' by which different subsystems contribute to the total reaction. If a system can be shown to have essential nonlinearities of no higher than second order it is possible to calculate, from a Fourier analysis of the average movement response, the ``weight'' by which the nonlinear interaction between any two input elements contributes to the total reaction. This interaction is termed ``elementary movement detector''. By the analysis presented here the arrangement of the elementary movement detectors may be determined for a two-dimensional array of input elements and the strength of their contributions to the total movement reaction may be calculated. Special experimental methods have been developed which allow one to apply this analysis to the visual system of the fruitfly Drosophila. The preliminary data presented show that the direction sensitive optomotor response of Drosophila can be attributed predominantly to the contributions from two ``elementary movement detectors'' which interconnect neighbouring visual elements. The detectors are oriented in the hexagonal array of the compound eye at +30$^\circ$ and at-30$^\circ$ with respect to the horizontal line of symmetry. A weak contribution from a detector between neighbouring elements along the horizontal line of symmetry is suggested by the present data. In the course of the analysis the contrast transfer properties of the compound eye are characterized.},

The purpose of the present study was to assess whether the association between sleep duration and mortality varies with age. Prospective cohort study. 43,863 individuals (64\% women), recruited in September 1997 during the Swedish National March and followed through record-linkages for 13 years. Sleep duration was self-reported and measured using the Karolinska Sleep Questionnaire, and grouped into 4 categories: $\leq$5, 6, 7 (reference) and $\geq$8 h. Up to 2010 3548 deaths occurred. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models with attained age as time scale were fitted to estimate mortality rate ratios. Among individuals $<$65 years, short ($\leq$5 h) and long ($\geq$8 h) sleep duration showed a significant relationship with mortality (HR 1.37, 95\% CI 1.09\textendash{}1.71, and HR 1.27, 95\% CI 1.08\textendash{}1.48). Among individuals 65 years or older, no relationships between sleep duration and mortality were observed. The effect of short and long sleep duration on mortality was highest among young individuals and decreased with increasing age. The results suggest that age plays an important role in the relationship between sleep duration and mortality.},

  abstract = {Why do some individuals need more sleep than others? Forward mutagenesis screens in flies using engineered mutations have established a clear genetic component to sleep duration, revealing mutants that convey very long or short sleep. Whether such extreme long or short sleep could exist in natural populations was unknown. We applied artificial selection for high and low night sleep duration to an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster for 13 generations. At the end of the selection procedure, night sleep duration diverged by 9.97 hours in the long and short sleeper populations, and 24-hour sleep was reduced to 3.3 hours in the short sleepers. Neither long nor short sleeper lifespan differed appreciably from controls, suggesting little physiological consequences to being an extreme long or short sleeper. Whole genome sequence data from seven generations of selection revealed several hundred thousand changes in allele frequencies at polymorphic loci across the genome. Combining the data from long and short sleeper populations across generations in a logistic regression implicated 126 polymorphisms in 80 candidate genes, and we confirmed three of these genes and a larger genomic region with mutant and chromosomal deficiency tests, respectively. Many of these genes could be connected in a single network based on previously known physical and genetic interactions. Candidate genes have known roles in several classic, highly conserved developmental and signaling pathways-EGFR, Wnt, Hippo, and MAPK. The involvement of highly pleiotropic pathway genes suggests that sleep duration in natural populations can be influenced by a wide variety of biological processes, which may be why the purpose of sleep has been so elusive.},

Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a genetically transmitted neurodegenerative prion disease that incurs great suffering and has neither a treatment nor a cure. The clinical literature is devoid of management plans (other than palliative). Part 1 of this article reviews the sparse literature about FFI, including case descriptions. Part 2 of this paper describes the efforts of 1 patient (with the rapid-course Met-Met subtype) to contend with his devastating symptoms and improve the quality of his life.

Design
Interventions were based on the premise that some symptoms may be secondary to insomnia and not a direct result of the disease itself. Strategies (derived by trial and error) were devised to induce sleep and increase alertness. Interventions included vitamin supplementation, narcoleptics, anesthesia, stimulants, sensory deprivation, exercise, light entrainment, growth hormone, and electroconvulsive therapy.

Results
The patient exceeded the average survival time by nearly 1 year, and during this time (when most patients are totally incapacitated), he was able to write a book and to successfully drive hundreds of miles.

Conclusion
Methods to induce sleep may extend and enhance life during the disease, although they do not prevent death. It is hoped that some of his methods might inspire further clinical studies.},

  abstract = {Despite the ubiquitous nature of sleep, its functions remain a mystery. In an attempt to address this, many researchers have studied behavioural and electrophysiological phenomena associated with sleep in a diversity of animals. The great majority of vertebrates and invertebrates display a phase of immobility that could be considered as a sort of sleep. Terrestrial mammals and birds, both homeotherms, show two sleep states with distinct behavioural and electrophysiological features. However, whether these features have evolved independently in each clade or were inherited from a common ancestor remains unknown. Unfortunately, amphibians and reptiles, key taxa in understanding the evolution of sleep given their position at the base of the tetrapod and amniote tree, respectively, remain poorly studied in the context of sleep. This review presents an overview of what is known about sleep in amphibians and reptiles and uses the existing data to provide a preliminary analysis of the evolution of behavioural and electrophysiological features of sleep in amphibians and reptiles. We also discuss the problems associated with analysing existing data, as well as the difficulty in inferring homologies of sleep stages based on limited data in the context of an essentially mammalian-centric definition of sleep. Finally, we highlight the importance of developing comparative approaches to sleep research that may benefit from the great diversity of species with different ecologies and morphologies in order to understand the evolution and functions of sleep.},

The tide creates a cyclical availability of oxygen with animals having access to oxygenated water during episodes of submergence, while access to oxygen is restricted during aerial emergence. Here we performed liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry enabled metabolomic profiling of gill samples isolated from the California ribbed mussel, Mytilus californianus, to investigate how metabolism is orchestrated in this variable environment. We created a simulated intertidal environment in which mussels were acclimated to alternating high and low tides of 6 h duration, and samples were taken every 2 h for 72 h to capture reproducible changes in metabolite levels over six high and six low tides. We quantified 169 named metabolites of which 24 metabolites cycled significantly with a 12-h period that was linked to the tidal cycle. These data confirmed the presence of alternating phases of fermentation and aerobic metabolism and highlight a role for carnitine-conjugated metabolites during the anaerobic phase of this cycle. Mussels at low tide accumulated eight carnitine-conjugated metabolites, arising from the degradation of fatty acids, branched-chain amino acids, and mitochondrial $\beta$-oxidation end products. The data also implicate sphingosine as a potential signaling molecule during aerial emergence. These findings identify new levels of metabolic control whose role in intertidal adaptation remains to be elucidated.},

Seeds of 33 annual weed species, each represented by three populations, were tested in light and darkness 7 weeks after harvest and after two stratification treatments: 18 weeks at 3 $^\circ$C in the laboratory and 19 weeks outdoors in soil during winter. Cold stratification removed population differences in some species, but in several species such differences became apparent only after stratification. This happened either because dormancy became stronger in weakly dormant seeds (winter annuals) or weaker in strongly dormant seeds (summer annuals). In several species, the light requirement for germination increased after stratification. These results clearly indicate that germination tests performed on fresh seeds from a single population may not adequately predict germination percentages in the field.},

The view that torpor is an evolutionary extension of sleep is supported by electrophysiological studies. However, comparisons of factors that influence the expression of sleep and torpor uncover significant differences. Deep sleep immediately following torpor suggests that torpor is functionally a period of sleep deprivation. Recent studies that employ post-torpor sleep deprivation, however, show that the post-torpor intense sleep is not homeostatically regulated, but might be a reflection of synaptic loss and replacement. The circadian system regulates sleep expression in euthermic mammals in such a way that would appear to preclude multiday bouts of torpor. Indeed, the circadian system is robust in animals that show shallow torpor, but its activity in hibernators is at least damped if not absent. There is good evidence from some species, however, that the circadian system plays important roles in the timing of bouts of torpor.},

  volume = {53},
  abstract = {Restoration or repair must, like growth, depend on protein synthesis. This chapter presents evidence to support this proposition from nearly 60 reports showing that rates of protein synthesis or of mitotic division are higher at the time of rest and sleep. In addition, the chapter presents a theory, based on fundamental principles, to explain why this should be so. Oscillations about a mean are inherent in any system subject to feedback control, and this is true of all living systems. In the simplest organisms there are oscillations between food-engulfing activity on the one hand and inactivity with assimilation on the other. There will also be oscillations between a state in which degradative chemical processes are accelerated and one in which synthetic processes are enhanced. It is proposed in this chapter that it is the differing energy demands of the activity/inactivity rhythm that chiefly determine the degradative/synthetic rhythm, such that the synthetic period inevitably coincides with the inactive or rest period, and that this is equally true in higher organisms in which a central nervous system ensures rest's integrity through positive unresponsiveness during sleep, and that such relationships, present throughout the animal kingdom, rely upon a fundamental metabolic co-coordinator, the ``cellular energy charge''. The energy charge is a measure of the available free energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).},

  title = {Brain-{{Immune}} Interactions in Sleep},
  volume = {52},
  abstract = {This chapter discusses various levels of interactions between the brain and the immune system in sleep. Sleep-wake behavior and the architecture of sleep are influenced by microbial products and cytokines. On the other hand, sleep processes, and perhaps also specific sleep states, appear to promote the production and/or release of certain cytokines. The effects of immune factors such as endotoxin and cytokines on sleep reveal species specificity and usually strong dependence on parameters such as substance concentration, time relative to administration or infection with microbial products, and phase relation to sleep and/or the light-dark cycle. For instance, endotoxin increased SWS and EEG SWA in humans only at very low concentrations, whereas higher concentrations increased sleep stage 2 only, but not SWS. In animals, increases in NREM sleep and SWA were more consistent over a wide range of endotoxin doses. Also, administration of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IFN-$\alpha$ in humans acutely disturbed sleep while in rats such cytokines enhanced SWS and sleep. Overall, the findings in humans indicate that strong nonspecific immune responses are acutely linked to an arousing effect. Although subjects feel subjectively tired, their sleep flattens. However, some observations indicate a delayed enhancing effect on sleep which could be related to the induction of secondary, perhaps T -cell-related factors. This would also fit with results in animals in which the Tcell-derived cytokine IL-2 enhanced sleep while cytokines with immunosuppressive functions like IL-4 and L-10 suppressed sleep. The most straightforward similarity in the cascade of events inducing sleep in both animals and humans is the enhancing effect of GHRH on SWS, and possibly the involvement of the pro-inflammatory cytokine systems of IL-1$\beta$ and TNF-$\alpha$. The precise mechanisms through which administered cytokines influence the central nervous system sleep processes are still unclear, although extensive research has identified the involvement of various molecular intermediates, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters (cp. Fig. 5, Section III.B). Cytokines are not only released and found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but also in peripheral nerves and the brain (e.g., Hansen and Krueger, 1997; M\"arz et al., 1998). Cytokines are thereby able to influence the central nervous system sleep processes through different routes. In addition, neuronal and filial sources have been reported for various cytokines as well as for their soluble receptors (e.g., Kubota et al., 2001a). Links between the immune and endocrine systems represent a further important route through which cytokines influence sleep and, vice versa, sleep-associated processes, including variations in neurotransmitter and neuronal activity may influence cytokine levels. The ability of sleep to enhance the release and/or production of certain cytokines was also discussed. Most consistent results were found for IL-2, which may indicate a sleep-associated increase in activity of the specific immune system. Furthermore, in humans the primary response to antigens following viral challenge is enhanced by sleep. In animals results are less consistent and have focused on the secondary response. The sleep-associated modulation in cytokine levels may be mediated by endocrine parameters. Patterns of endocrine activity during sleep are probably essential for the enhancement of IL-2 and T-cell diurnal functions seen in humans: Whereas prolactin and GH release stimulate Thl-derived cytokines such as IL-2, cortisol which is decreased during the beginning of nocturnal sleep inhibits Th1-derived cytokines. The immunological function of neurotrophins, in particular NGF and BDNF, has received great interest. Effects of sleep and sleep deprivation on this cytokine family are particularly relevant in view of the effects these endogenous neurotrophins can have not only on specific immune functions and the development of immunological memories, but also on synaptic reorganization and neuronal memory formation (e.g., Rachal el al., 2001).},

To address this issue, we determined the effects of Staphylococcus aureus infection on rabbit sleep. Rabbits inoculated intravenously with S. aureus demonstrated the expected physiological changes consistent with a state of infectious disease (e.g., lymphopenia, neutrophilia, and fever), as well as time-dependent changes in sleep patterns. The sleep changes were characterized initially by increases in (i) the time spent in slow-wave sleep, (ii) the electroencephalographic slow-wave amplitudes during slow-wave sleep, and (iii) the duration of individual bouts of slow-wave sleep. At 20 to 36 h after inoculation, sleep responses fell to levels below corresponding control values for 6 to 12 h. At 6 to 10 h after inoculation, rapid-eye-movement sleep was suppressed and remained at low levels throughout the remainder of the 48-h recording period. These effects of bacterial infection on sleep were attenuated by antibiotic (cephalothin) therapy. Inoculation with killed bacteria produced similar changes in sleep and other physiological parameters, although significantly higher numbers of organisms were required to produce equivalent responses. We postulate that changes in sleep may represent an adaptive response of the host to infectious disease.},

Twenty-four hour recordings were made before and after intraperitoneal injection of vehicle or 30 or 100 micrograms/kg LPS at lights on. During the first 12 h after administration of both doses of LPS, Tbr was elevated, REMS duration was reduced, and non-REMS duration was unchanged, whereas the non-REMS episodes were shortened. EEG activity within non-REMS from 0.5 to 7 Hz was enhanced during hours 3-12. During the second 12-h period, the number of non-REMS and REMS episodes and the total time in both states were increased. EEG activity within non-REMS was mainly reduced in the entire frequency range (0.5-25.5 Hz). The effects of LPS did not differ between the doses. The effects of LPS on EEG power spectra are similar to those observed after sleep deprivation, i.e., a physiological intensification of non-REMS, indicating that both manipulations may activate common sleep EEG regulatory mechanisms. However, the disruption of non-REMS continuity following LPS administration at light onset contrasts the changes induced by sleep deprivation and may reflect an effect of a systemic inflammatory response on sleep maintenance.},

Drosophila sleep studies have unearthed an immense wealth of knowledge about the neuroscience of sleep. Given the breadth of findings published on Drosophila sleep, it is important to consider how all of this information might come together to generate a more holistic understanding of sleep. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the neurobiology of Drosophila sleep and explores the broader insights and implications of how sleep is regulated across species and why it is necessary for the brain.},

To clarify this, we developed a simple model of short-term sleep deprivation, in which fruit-flies were submitted to a nocturnal light condition and then mitochondrial parameters were assessed by high resolution respirometry (HRR). Exposure of flies to constant light was able to alter sleep patterns, causing locomotor deficits, increasing ROS production and lipid peroxidation, affecting mitochondrial activity, antioxidant defense enzymes and caspase activity. HRR analysis showed that sleep deprivation affected mitochondrial bioenergetics capacity, decreasing respiration at oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and electron transport system (ETS). In addition, the expression of genes involved in the response to oxidative stress and apoptosis were increased. Thus, our results suggest a connection between sleep deprivation and oxidative stress, pointing to mitochondria as a possible target of this relationship.},

The increase in sleep was associated with an increase in the number of nighttime sleep bouts or episodes, but not in sleep bout duration. Correspondingly, Wolbachia infection also reduced the arousal threshold of their fly hosts. However, neither circadian rhythm nor sleep rebound following deprivation was influenced by Wolbachia infection. Transcriptional analysis of the dopamine biosynthesis pathway revealed that two essential genes, Pale and Ddc, were significantly upregulated in Wolbachia-infected flies. Together, these results indicate that Wolbachia mediates the expression of dopamine related genes, and decreases the sleep quality of their insect hosts.

None of the behaviors were largely influenced by the absence of a microbiome, and the small or moderate effects were not generalizable between replicates and/or generations.

  abstract = {Molecular and circuit mechanisms for balancing competing drives are not well understood. While circadian and homeostatic mechanisms generally ensure sufficient sleep at night, other pressing needs can overcome sleep drive. Here, we demonstrate that the balance between sleep and sex drives determines whether male flies sleep or court, and identify a subset of octopaminergic neurons (MS1) that regulate sleep specifically in males. When MS1 neurons are activated, isolated males sleep less, and when MS1 neurons are silenced, the normal male sleep suppression in female presence is attenuated and mating behavior is impaired. MS1 neurons do not express the sexually dimorphic FRUITLESS (FRU) transcription factor, but form male-specific contacts with FRU-expressing neurons; calcium imaging experiments reveal bidirectional functional connectivity between MS1 and FRU neurons. We propose octopaminergic MS1 neurons interact with the FRU network to mediate sleep suppression by male sex drive., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23130.001, Most people sleep for around seven or eight hours at night, but if there is something important or interesting to do \textendash{} for example, taking care of a baby, finishing a task before a deadline, or watching an entertaining movie \textendash{} we may stay up late. In other words, sleep is regulated by motivational states. The drive to sleep accumulates during wakefulness and decreases during sleep. Thus sleep and other motivational drives compete to decide whether we sleep or engage in other important or interesting activities., The idea that sleep and sex drives might compete with each other is intuitive, but had not been studied experimentally. Machado, Afonso et al. have now studied how this competition determines the behavior of male fruit flies. The presence of a female fly usually keeps a male fly awake at night. However, a male that has recently mated several times (and has low sex drive) or one that was sleep deprived (and has high sleep drive) ignores the female and goes to sleep., Further investigation revealed a small number of previously unknown neurons (termed MS1) are required for sexual arousal to overcome the male's desire to sleep. These neurons do not belong to a circuit that is known to be important for male sexual behavior, but they do communicate with that circuit using a neurotransmitter called octopamine. This communication suppresses sleep and promotes courtship., The next steps will be to identify the specific neurons that communicate directly with the MS1 neurons and to determine whether MS1 neurons have a direct role in regulating sex drive. Investigating these details will help us to understand more generally how competing drives influence behavioral choices., DOI:

Previously, microarrays have been used to examine gene expression of females differing in their reproductive status with the aim of identifying genes influenced by mating. However, as only virgin and single mated females were compared, transcriptional changes associated with reproduction (under natural selection) and male-induced effects (possibly under sexually antagonistic selection) cannot be disentangled. We partitioned these fundamentally different effects by instead examining the expression profiles of virgin, single mated and double mated females. We found substantial effects relating to reproduction and further effects that are only attributable to mating itself. Immune response genes dominate this male-induced effect indicating that the cost of mating may be due partly to this system's activation. We propose that both sexually antagonistic and natural selection have been important in the evolution of the innate immunity genes, thereby contributing to the sexual dimorphism and rapid evolution at these loci.},

Animals often decide between alternative actions according to their current needs, and hence the value they assign to each of the competing options [1\textendash{}4]. This process is of special relevance during nutrient balancing, in which animals choose between different food sources according to their current nutritional state [5\textendash{}7]. How such value-based decision making is implemented at the molecular and neuronal level in the brain is not well understood. Here we describe Drosophila melanogaster food choice as a genetically tractable model to study value-based decision making in the context of nutrient balancing. When faced with a choice between yeast and an alternative food source, flies deprived of protein prefer the yeast. We show here that mating status is a critical modulator of this decision-making process in females and that it relies on the action of the sex peptide receptor in internal ppk+ sensory neurons. Neuronal TOR/S6K function is another critical input to this decision, possibly signaling the fly's current nutritional status. We propose that the brain uses these internal states to assign value to external sensory information from potential food sources, thereby guiding food choice and ensuring nutrient homeostasis.},

  abstract = {Summary
To optimize survival and reproduction, animals must match their nutrient intake to their current needs. Reproduction profoundly changes nutritional requirements, with many species showing an appetite for sodium during reproductive periods. How this internal state modifies neuronal information processing to ensure homeostasis is not understood. Here, we show that dietary sodium levels positively affect reproductive output in Drosophila melanogaster; to satisfy this requirement, females develop a strong, specific appetite for sodium following mating. We show that mating modulates gustatory processing to increase the probability of initiating feeding on salt. This postmating effect is not due to salt depletion by egg production, since abolishing egg production leaves the sodium appetite intact. Rather, the salt appetite is induced need-independently by male-derived Sex Peptide acting on the Sex Peptide Receptor in female reproductive tract neurons. We~further demonstrate that postmating appetites for both salt and yeast are driven by the resultant silencing of downstream SAG neurons. Surprisingly, unlike the postmating yeast appetite, the salt appetite does not require octopamine, suggesting a divergence in the postmating circuitry. These findings demonstrate that the postmating circuit supports reproduction by increasing the palatability of specific nutrients. Such a feedforward regulation of sensory processing may represent a common mechanism through which reproductive state-sensitive circuits modify complex behaviors across species.},

  abstract = {Despite its evolutionary importance and apparent ubiquity among animals, the ecological significance of sleep is largely unresolved. The ecology of sleep has been particularly neglected in invertebrates. In insects, recent neurobehavioral research convincingly demonstrates that resting behavior shares several common characteristics with sleep in vertebrates. Laboratory studies have produced compelling evidence that sleep disruption can cause changes in insect daily activity patterns (via ``sleep rebound'') and have consequences for behavioral performance during active periods. However, factors that could cause insect sleep disruption in nature have not been considered nor have the ecological consequences. Drawing on evidence from laboratory studies, we argue that sleep disruption may be an overlooked component of insect ecology and could be caused by a variety of anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic factors in nature. We identify several candidate sleep-disrupting factors and provide new insights on the potential consequences of sleep disruption on individual fitness, species interactions, and ecosystem services. We propose an experimental framework to bridge the current gap in knowledge between laboratory and field studies. We conclude that sleep disruption is a potential mechanism underpinning variation in behavioral, population, and community-level processes associated with several aspects of global change.},

We believe that an explicit description of this vulnerability will provide many insights into both the function and architecture (or organization) of sleep. Early studies of sleep recognized this idea, but it has been largely overlooked during the last 20 years. We critically evaluate early models that suggested that the function of sleep is antipredator in nature, and outline a new model in which we argue that whole-brain or `blackout' sleep may be the safest way to sleep given a functionally interconnected brain. Early comparative work also suggested that the predatory environment is an important determinant of sleep architecture. For example, species that sleep in risky environments spend less time in the relatively vulnerable states of sleep. Recent experimental work suggests that mammals and birds shift to relatively vigilant (lighter) states of sleep in response to an increase in perceived risk; these results mirror the influence of stress on sleep in humans and rats. We also outline a conceptual model of sleep architecture in which dynamic changes in sleep states reflect a trade-off between the benefits of reducing a sleep debt and the cost of predation. Overall, many aspects of plasticity in sleep related to predation risk require further study, as do the ways in which sleeping animals monitor predatory threats. More work outside of the dominant mammalian paradigm in sleep is also needed. An ecologically based view of sleeping under the risk of predation will provide an important complement to the traditional physiological and neurological approaches to studying sleep and its functions.},

They are predominantly transmitted vertically from mother to offspring but also occasionally horizontally between species. In doing so, they infect a huge range of arthropod species worldwide. Recently, a statistical analysis estimated the infection frequency of Wolbachia among arthropod hosts to be 66\%. At the same time, the authors of this analysis highlighted some weaknesses of the underlying data and concluded that in order to improve the estimate, a larger number of individuals per species should be assayed and species be chosen more randomly. Here we apply the statistical approach to a more appropriate data set from a recent survey that tested both a broad range of species and a sufficient number of individuals per species. Indeed, we find a substantially different infection frequency: We now estimate the proportion of Wolbachia-infected species to be around 40\% which is lower than the previous estimate but still points to a surprisingly high number of arthropods harboring the bacteria. Notwithstanding this difference, we confirm the previous result that, within a given species, typically most or only a few individuals are infected. Moreover, we extend our analysis to include several reproductive parasites other than Wolbachia that were also screened for in the aforementioned empirical survey. For these symbionts we find a large variation in estimated infection frequencies and corroborate the finding that Wolbachia are the most abundant endosymbionts among arthropod species.},

  abstract = {Wolbachia are intracellular bacteria that infect a vast range of arthropod species, making them one of the most prevalent endosymbionts in the world. Wolbachia's stunning evolutionary success is mostly due to their reproductive parasitism but also to mutualistic effects such as increased host fecundity or protection against pathogens. However, the mechanisms underlying Wolbachia phenotypes, both parasitic and mutualistic, are only poorly understood. Moreover, it is unclear how the insect immune system is involved in these phenotypes and why it is not more successful in eliminating the bacteria. Here we argue that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are likely to be key in elucidating these issues. ROS are essential players in the insect immune system, and Wolbachia infection can affect ROS levels in the host. Based on recent findings, we elaborate a hypothesis that considers the different effects of Wolbachia on the oxidative environment in novel vs. native hosts. We propose that newly introduced Wolbachia trigger an immune response and cause oxidative stress, whereas in coevolved symbioses, infection is not associated with oxidative stress, but rather with restored redox homeostasis. Redox homeostasis can be restored in different ways, depending on whether Wolbachia or the host is in charge. This hypothesis offers a mechanistic explanation for several of the observed Wolbachia phenotypes.},

Here, we show that a strain of Wolbachia influences male aggression in flies, which is critically important in mate competition. A specific strain of Wolbachia was observed to reduce the initiation of aggressive encounters in Drosophila males compared to the behavior of their uninfected controls. To determine how Wolbachia was able to alter aggressive behavior, we investigated the role of octopamine, a neurotransmitter known to influence male aggressive behavior in many insect species. Transcriptional analysis of the octopamine biosynthesis pathway revealed that two essential genes, the tyrosine decarboxylase and tyramine $\beta$-hydroxylase genes, were significantly downregulated in Wolbachia-infected flies. Quantitative chemical analysis also showed that total octopamine levels were significantly reduced in the adult heads.},

Here we report sex-specific behavioural responses to these infections in D. melanogaster. DCV infection caused increased sleep in female flies, but had no detectable effect in male flies. The presence of Wolbachia did not reduce this behavioural response to viral infection.

Texas field crickets (Gryllus texensis) exhibited a modest fever (1 $^\circ$C increase in preferred body temperature, T pref) after injection of prostaglandin, which putatively mediates fever in both vertebrates and invertebrates, but they did not exhibit fever during chronic exposure to heat-killed bacteria. Further, chronic food limitation and mating status did not affect T pref or the expression of behavioural fever, suggesting limited context dependency of fever in G. texensis. Our meta-analysis of behavioural fever studies indicated that behavioural fever occurs in many insects, but it is not ubiquitous. Thus, both empirical and meta-analytical results suggest that the fever response in insects `is widespread, although certainly not inevitable' (Moore 2002). We highlight the need for future work focusing on standardizing an experimental protocol to measure behavioural fever, understanding the specific mechanism(s) underlying fever in insects, and examining whether ecological or physiological costs often outweigh the benefits of fever and can explain the sporadic nature of fever in insects.},

Previous work in Drosophila has defined two populations of circadian brain neurons, morning cells (M-cells) and evening cells (E-cells), both of which keep circadian time and regulate morning and evening activity, respectively. It has long been speculated that a multiple oscillator circadian network in animals underlies the behavioral and physiological pattern variability caused by seasonal fluctuations of photoperiod. We have manipulated separately the circadian photoentrainment pathway within E- and M-cells and show that E-cells process light information and function as master clocks in the~presence of light. M-cells in contrast need darkness to cycle autonomously and dominate the network. The results indicate that the network switches control between these two centers as a function of photoperiod. Together with the different entraining properties of the two clock centers, the results suggest that the~functional organization of the network underlies the behavioral adjustment to variations in daylength and season.},

Their social experience affects this behavior, with social isolation reducing and mating enhancing social space respectively, in both males and females. Unlike several other social behaviors in the fly, including the formation of social groups themselves (a well described behavior - Bartelt et al., 1985, De Gee et al., 2008, Lof et al., 2008, Lof et al., 2009), social space does not require the perception of the previously identified aggregation pheromone cis-Vaccenyl Acetate (Bartelt et al., 1985).

We wondered whether flies explore their environment in a cooperative way as interactions between individual flies within a population might influence the flies' ability to locate food sources. We have shown that the food search behavior in the fruit fly Drosophila is a two-step process. Firstly, 'primer' flies search the environment and randomly land on different food patches. Secondly, the remaining group of flies move to the most favorable food source and aggregate there. We call this a 'search-aggregation' cycle. Our data demonstrate that flies do not individually assess all available food resources. Rather, social interactions between flies appear to affect their choice of a specific food patch. A genetic analysis of this 'search-aggregation' behavior shows that flies carrying mutations in specific genes (for example, the dunce (dnc) gene which codes for a phosphodiesterase) were defective in this search-aggregation behavior when compared to normal flies. Future investigations of the neuronal signaling involved in this behavior will help us to understand the complexities of this aspect of Drosophila social behaviour.},

  abstract = {Losing a fight (social defeat) induces submissiveness and behavioral depression in many animals, but the mechanisms are unclear. Here we investigate how the social defeat syndrome can be established as a result of experiencing aversive stimuli and the roles of neuromodulators in the process. While biogenic amines and nitric oxide (NO) are associated with reduced aggression in mammals and insects, their specific actions during conflict are unknown. Although the social defeat syndrome normally results from complex interactions, we could induce it in male crickets simply by applying aversive stimuli (AS) in an aggressive context. Aggressive crickets became immediately submissive and behaved like losers after experiencing two brief AS (light wind puffs to the cerci), but only when preceded by a priming stimulus (PS, stroking the antenna with another male antenna). Notably, submissiveness was not induced when the PS preceded the AS by more than 1 min, or when the PS followed the AS, or using a female antenna as the preceding stimulus. These findings suggest that any potentially detrimental stimulus can acquire the attribute of an aversive agonistic signal when experienced in an aggressive context. Crickets, it seems, need only to evaluate their net sensory impact rather than the qualities of a variety of complex agonistic signals. Selective drug treatments revealed that NO, but not serotonin, dopamine or octopamine, is necessary to establish the submissive status following pairing of the priming and aversive stimuli. Moreover, treatment with an NO donor also induced the social defeat syndrome, but only when combined with the PS. This confirms our hypothesis that aversive agonistic experiences accumulated by crickets during fighting invoke social defeat via the action of NO and illustrates that a relatively simple mechanism underlies the seemingly complex social decision to flee. The simple stimulus regime for inducing social defeat opens new avenues for investigating the cellular control of subordinate behavior and post-conflict depression.},

In Drosophila, both males and females compete in same sex fights for resources, but only males establish hierarchical relationships.

This review begins with an examination of the behavior, both from a historical perspective and then from the birth of the ``modern'' era of studies of aggression in fruit flies including its quantitative analysis. The review continues with examinations of the roles of genes, neurotransmitters and neurohormones, peptides, nutritional and metabolic status, and surface cuticular hydrocarbons in the initiation and maintenance of aggression.

Consolidation of hippocampus-dependent memories relies on a dialog between the neocortex and hippocampus. Crucial features of this dialog are the neuronal reactivation of new memories in the hippocampus during SWS, which stimulates the redistribution of memory representations to neocortical networks; and the neocortical slow ($<$1Hz) oscillation that synchronizes hippocampal-to-neocortical information transfer to activity in other brain structures.},

  abstract = {Relational memory, the flexible ability to generalize across existing stores of information, is a fundamental property of human cognition. Little is known, however, about how and when this inferential knowledge emerges. Here, we test the hypothesis that human relational memory develops during offline time periods. Fifty-six participants initially learned five ``premise pairs'' (A$>$B, B$>$C, C$>$D, D$>$E, and E$>$F). Unknown to subjects, the pairs contained an embedded hierarchy (A$>$B$>$C$>$D$>$E$>$F). Following an offline delay of either 20 min, 12 hr (wake or sleep), or 24 hr, knowledge of the hierarchy was tested by examining inferential judgments for novel ``inference pairs'' (B$>$D, C$>$E, and B$>$E). Despite all groups achieving near-identical premise pair retention after the offline delay (all groups, $>$85\%; the building blocks of the hierarchy), a striking dissociation was evident in the ability to make relational inference judgments: the 20-min group showed no evidence of inferential ability (52\%), whereas the 12- and 24-hr groups displayed highly significant relational memory developments (inference ability of both groups, $>$75\%; P $<$ 0.001). Moreover, if the 12-hr period contained sleep, an additional boost to relational memory was seen for the most distant inferential judgment (the B$>$E pair; sleep = 93\%, wake = 69\%, P = 0.03). Interestingly, despite this increase in performance, the sleep benefit was not associated with an increase in subjective confidence for these judgments. Together, these findings demonstrate that human relational memory develops during offline time delays. Furthermore, sleep appears to preferentially facilitate this process by enhancing hierarchical memory binding, thereby allowing superior performance for the more distant inferential judgments, a benefit that may operate below the level of conscious awareness.},

Anecdotal reports on scientific discovery suggest that pivotal insights can be gained through sleep3.

Subjects performed a cognitive task requiring the learning of stimulus\textendash{}response sequences, in which they improved gradually by increasing response speed across task blocks. However, they could also improve abruptly after gaining insight into a hidden abstract rule underlying all sequences. Initial training establishing a task representation was followed by 8 h of nocturnal sleep, nocturnal wakefulness, or daytime wakefulness. At subsequent retesting, more than twice as many subjects gained insight into the hidden rule after sleep as after wakefulness, regardless of time of day. Sleep did not enhance insight in the absence of initial training. A characteristic antecedent of sleep-related insight was revealed in a slowing of reaction times across sleep. We conclude that sleep, by restructuring new memory representations, facilitates extraction of explicit knowledge and insightful behaviour.},

The need to sleep grows with the duration of wakefulness and dissipates with time spent asleep,~a process called sleep homeostasis. What are the consequences of staying awake on brain cells, and why is sleep needed? Surprisingly, we do not know whether the firing of cortical neurons is affected by how long an animal has been awake or asleep. Here, we found that after sustained wakefulness cortical neurons fire at higher frequencies in all behavioral states. During early NREM sleep after sustained wakefulness, periods of population activity (ON) are short, frequent, and associated with synchronous firing, while periods of neuronal silence are long and frequent. After sustained sleep, firing rates and synchrony decrease, while the duration of ON periods increases. Changes in firing patterns in NREM sleep correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep homeostasis. Thus, the systematic increase of firing during wakefulness is counterbalanced by staying asleep.},

By recording miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) from frontal cortex slices of mice and rats that had been awake or asleep, we found that the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs increased after waking and decreased after sleep, independent of time of day. Recovery sleep after deprivation also decreased mEPSCs, suggesting that sleep favors synaptic homeostasis. Since stronger synapses require more energy, space, and supplies, a generalized renormalization of synapses may be an important function of sleep.},

  abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that sleep contributes to memory formation and learning, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are incompletely understood. To investigate the impact of sleep on excitatory synaptic transmission, we obtained whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from layer V pyramidal neurons in acute slices of somatosensory cortex of juvenile rats (postnatal days 21-25). In animals after the dark period, philanthotoxin 74 (PhTx)-sensitive calcium-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) accounted for $\sim$25\% of total EPSP size, and current-voltage (I-V) relationships of the underlying EPSCs showed inward rectification. In contrast, in similar experiments after the light period, EPSPs were PhTx insensitive with linear I-V characteristics, indicating that CP-AMPARs were less abundant. Combined EEG and EMG recordings confirmed that slow-wave sleep-associated delta wave power peaked at the onset of the more quiescent, lights-on phase of the cycle. Subsequently, we show that burst firing, a characteristic action potential discharge mode of layer V pyramidal neurons during slow-wave sleep has a dual impact on synaptic AMPA receptor composition: repetitive burst firing without synaptic stimulation eliminated CP-AMPARs by activating serine/threonine phosphatases. Additionally, repetitive burst-firing paired with EPSPs led to input-specific long-term depression (LTD), affecting Ca(2+) impermeable AMPARs via protein kinase C signaling. In agreement with two parallel mechanisms, simple bursts were ineffective after the light period but paired bursts induced robust LTD. In contrast, incremental LTD was generated by both conditioning protocols after the dark cycle. Together, our results demonstrate qualitative changes at neocortical glutamatergic synapses that can be induced by discharge patterns characteristic of non-rapid eye movement sleep.},

In addition, effects of sleep on recall were compared with those of early and late retention intervals filled with wakefulness. Twenty healthy men served as subjects. Saliva cortisol concentrations were determined before and after the retention intervals to determine pituitary-adrenal secretory activity. Sleep was determined somnopolygraphically. Sleep generally enhanced recall when compared with the effects of corresponding retention intervals of wakefulness. The benefit from sleep on recall depended on the phase of sleep and on the type of memory: Recall of paired-associate lists improved more during early sleep, and recall of mirror-tracing skills improved more during late sleep. The effects may reflect different influences of slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep since time in SWS was 5 times longer during the early than late sleep retention interval, and time in REM sleep was twice as long during late than early sleep (p $<$ 0.005). Changes in cortisol concentrations, which independently of sleep and wakefulness were lower during early retention intervals than late ones, cannot account for the effects of sleep on memory. The experiments for the first time dissociate specific effects of early and late sleep on two principal types of memory, declarative and procedural, in humans.},

Here, we report data for subjects trained and retested on a sequential finger-tapping task across multiple days. The findings demonstrate firstly that following initial training, small practice-dependent improvements are possible before, but not following the large practice-independent gains that develop across a night of sleep. Secondly, doubling the quantity of initial training does not alter the amount of subsequent sleep-dependent learning that develops overnight. Thirdly, the amount of sleep-dependent learning does not correlate with the amount of practice-dependent learning achieved during training, suggesting the existence of two discrete motor-learning processes. Finally, whereas the majority of sleep-dependent motor-skill learning develops during the first night of sleep following training, additional nights of sleep still offer continued improvements.},

Traffic scene information can be used to optimize traffic flow during busy periods, identify stalled vehicles and accidents, and aid the decision-making of an autonomous vehicle controller. Improvements in technologies for machine vision-based surveillance and high-level symbolic reasoning have enabled the authors to develop a system for detailed, reliable traffic scene analysis. The machine vision component of the system employs a contour tracker and an affine motion model based on Kalman filters to extract vehicle trajectories over a sequence of traffic scene images. The symbolic reasoning component uses a dynamic belief network to make inferences about traffic events such as vehicle lane changes and stalls. In this paper, the authors discuss the key tasks of the vision and reasoning components as well as their integration into a working prototype. Preliminary results of an implementation on special purpose hardware using C-40 Digital Signal Processors show that near real-time performance can be achieved without further improvements},

  abstract = {The role of arousals in sleep is gaining interest among both basic researchers and clinicians. In the last 20 years increasing evidence shows that arousals are deeply involved in the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. The nature of arousals in sleep is still a matter of debate. According to the conceptual framework of the American Sleep Disorders Association criteria, arousals are a marker of sleep disruption representing a detrimental and harmful feature for sleep. In contrast, our view indicates arousals as elements weaved into the texture of sleep taking part in the regulation of the sleep process. In addition, the concept of micro-arousal (MA) has been extended, incorporating, besides the classical low-voltage fast-rhythm electroencephalographic (EEG) arousals, high-amplitude EEG bursts, be they like delta-like or K-complexes, which reflects a special kind of arousal process, mobilizing parallely antiarousal swings. In physiologic conditions, the slow and fast MA are not randomly scattered but appear structurally distributed within sleep representing state-specific arousal responses. MA preceded by slow waves occurs more frequently across the descending part of sleep cycles and in the first cycles, while the traditional fast type of arousals across the ascending slope of cycles prevails during the last third of sleep. The uniform arousal characteristics of these two types of MAs is supported by the finding that different MAs are associated with an increasing magnitude of vegetative activation ranging hierarchically from the weaker slow EEG types (coupled with mild autonomic activation) to the stronger rapid EEG types (coupled with a vigorous autonomic activation). Finally, it has been ascertained that MA are not isolated events but are basically endowed with a periodic nature expressed in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep by the cyclic alternating pattern (CAP). Understanding the role of arousals and CAP and the relationship between physiologic and pathologic MA can shed light on the adaptive properties of the sleeping brain and provide insight into the pathomechanisms of sleep disturbances. Functional significance of arousal in sleep, and particularly in NREM sleep, is to ensure the reversibility of sleep, without which it would be identical to coma. Arousals may connect the sleeper with the surrounding world maintaining the selection of relevant incoming information and adapting the organism to the dangers and demands of the outer world. In this dynamic perspective, ongoing phasic events carry on the one hand arousal influences and on the other elements of information processing. The other function of arousals is tailoring the more or less stereotyped endogenously determined sleep process driven by chemical influences according to internal and external demands. In this perspective, arousals shape the individual course of night sleep as a variation of the sleep program.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the history of research and the results of recent studies on the effects of sleep deprivation in animals and humans. Humans can bear several days of continuous sleeplessness, experiencing deterioration in wellbeing and effectiveness; however, also a shorter reduction in the sleep time may lead to deteriorated functioning. Sleeplessness accounts for impaired perception, difficulties in keeping concentration, vision disturbances, slower reactions, as well as the appearance of microepisodes of sleep during wakefulness which lead to lower capabilities and efficiency of task performance and to increased number of errors. Sleep deprivation results in poor memorizing, schematic thinking, which yields wrong decisions, and emotional disturbances such as deteriorated interpersonal responses and increased aggressiveness. The symptoms are accompanied by brain tissue hypometabolism, particularly in the thalamus, prefrontal, frontal and occipital cortex and motor speech centres. Sleep deficiency intensifies muscle tonus and coexisting tremor, speech performance becomes monotonous and unclear, and sensitivity to pain is higher. Sleeplessness also relates to the changes in the immune response and the pattern of hormonal secretion, of the growth hormone in particular. The risk of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease increases. The impairment of performance which is caused by 20-25 hours of sleeplessness is comparable to that after ethanol intoxication at the level of 0.10\% blood alcohol concentration. The consequences of chronic sleep reduction or a shallow sleep repeated for several days tend to accumulate and resemble the effects of acute sleep deprivation lasting several dozen hours. At work, such effects hinder proper performance of many essential tasks and in extreme situations (machine operation or vehicle driving), sleep loss may be hazardous to the worker and his/her environment.

But we show here that, unlike terrestrial mammals, killer-whale and bottlenose-dolphin neonates and their mothers show little or no typical sleep behaviour for the first postpartum month, avoiding obstacles and remaining mobile for 24 hours a day. We find that neonates and their mothers gradually increase the amount of time they spend resting to normal adult levels over a period of several months, but never exceed these levels. Our findings indicate either that sleep behaviour may not have the developmental and life-sustaining functions attributed to it, or that alternative mechanisms may have evolved in cetaceans.},

  abstract = {Behavioural sleep was assessed for 152 nights in 5 adult, 2 immature and 1 juvenile giraffes at a zoological garden, using continuous time-lapse video recording. Sleep occurred while the giraffes were standing (SS) and in recumbency (RS). Paradoxical sleep (PS) was recognized by the peculiar positioning of the head on the croup and by phasic events. The 24-h sleep profile had a main bimodal nocturnal sleep period between 20.00 and 07.00 hours, with a trough between 02.00 and 04.00 hours, and several short naps between 12.00 and 16.00 hours. Total sleep time (TST), excluding the juvenile, was 4.6 h, whereby PS comprised only 4.7\%. TST was not age dependent, but the lowest amount of RS and the highest amount of SS occurred in the oldest and the two oldest animals, respectively. Sleep was fragmented, as indicated by the predominance of RS episodes lasting less than 11 min. Sleep cycle duration was very variable with most values between 1 and 35 min (when no waking or RS was allowed within PS episodes), or 6-35 min (when the criteria for ending a PS episode allowed 1-2 min interruptions by RS). There were several indications for sleep regulation: (i) RS and SS complemented each other to yield a relatively stable daily value of TST; (ii) sleep was redistributed on nights following a day when the giraffes spent a few hours in an outside enclosure. The first peak of the bimodal sleep profile was absent and RS was more prominent in the second half of the night compared with nights following days spent in the barn; and (iii) napping was followed by a minor reduction of RS and an increase in SS in the subsequent night compared with nights following days without naps.},

We measured both the energetic metabolism and behaviour of greater mouse\textendash{}eared bats submitted to three different parasite loads (no, 20 and 40 mites) during whole daily cycles. Mites greatly affected their time and energy budgets. They caused increased grooming activity, reduced the overall time devoted to resting and provoked a dramatic shortening of resting bout duration. Correspondingly, the bats' overall metabolism (oxygen consumption) increased drastically with parasite intensity and, during the course of experiments, the bats lost more weight when infested with 40 rather than 20 or no parasites.

The animals were recorded continuously on time-lapse video tapes for 7-16 days consecutively. Seasonal changes in sleep behavior were studied by comparing summer (16-day) and winter (13-15-day) recordings; and sleep development was assessed by recording a mother and her infant for three consecutive nights per month for 15 months (age 5-19 months). Sleep occurred in a recumbent (RS) and in a standing position (standing sleep: SS). Although signs of paradoxical sleep (PS) were often evident, the exact onset and end of a PS episode could not be determined. Sleep onset occurred after 2100 hours, and sleep increased progressively reaching a maximum between 0100 and 0400 hours. Total sleep time (TST) in the adults comprised 4.0-6.5 hours per night (including 13.8-130.9 minutes of SS) and did not differ between the two groups. Seasonal differences were present in TST and in the distribution of sleep within the night; more sleep occurred in the winter. The duration of RS episodes in the adults was 72.0 minutes, a value far below the sleep-cycle length of 124 minutes that others have reported for elephants. TST in the infant decreased during the course of the 15-month recording period from 8.1 hours to 5.1 hours. SS occurred for the first time at the age of 9 months.},

  abstract = {Sleep and metabolism are physiologically and behaviorally intertwined; however, the molecular basis for their interaction remains poorly understood. Here, we identified a serine metabolic pathway as a key mediator for starvation-induced sleep suppression. Transcriptome analyses revealed that enzymes involved in serine biosynthesis were induced upon starvation in Drosophila melanogaster brains. Genetic mutants of astray (aay), a fly homolog of the rate-limiting phosphoserine phosphatase in serine biosynthesis, displayed reduced starvation-induced sleep suppression. In contrast, a hypomorphic mutation in a serine/threonine-metabolizing enzyme, serine/threonine dehydratase (stdh), exaggerated starvation-induced sleep suppression. Analyses of double mutants indicated that aay and stdh act on the same genetic pathway to titrate serine levels in the head as well as to adjust starvation-induced sleep behaviors. RNA interference-mediated depletion of aay expression in neurons, using cholinergic Gal4 drivers, phenocopied aay mutants, while a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist selectively rescued the exaggerated starvation-induced sleep suppression in stdh mutants. Taken together, these data demonstrate that neural serine metabolism controls sleep during starvation, possibly via cholinergic signaling. We propose that animals have evolved a sleep-regulatory mechanism that reprograms amino acid metabolism for adaptive sleep behaviors in response to metabolic needs.},

In the lab, adult surface fish show robust circadian rhythms in per1, which are retained in cave populations, but with substantial alterations. These changes may be due to increased levels of light-inducible genes in cavefish, including clock repressor per2. From a molecular standpoint, cavefish appear as if they experience `constant light' rather than perpetual darkness. Micos River samples show similar per1 oscillations to those in the lab. However, data from Chica Cave shows complete repression of clock function, while expression of several light-responsive genes is raised, including DNA repair genes. We propose that altered expression of light-inducible genes provides a selective advantage to cavefish at the expense of a damped circadian oscillator.},

  abstract = {Summary
Patterns of sleep vary widely among species [1, 2, 3, 4], but the functional and evolutionary principles responsible for this diversity remain unknown. The characin fish, Astyanax mexicanus, has eyed surface and numerous blind cave populations [5]. The cave populations are largely independent in their origins, and the species is ideal for studying the genetic bases of convergent evolution [5, 6, 7]. Here we show that this system is also uniquely valuable for the investigation of variability in patterns of sleep. We find that a clearly defined change in ecological conditions, from surface to cave, is correlated with a dramatic reduction in sleep in three independently derived cave populations of A.~mexicanus. Analyses of surface \texttimes{} cave hybrids show that the alleles for reduced sleep in the Pach\'on and Tinaja cave populations are dominant in effect to the surface alleles. Genetic analysis of hybrids between surface and Pach\'on cavefish suggests that only a small number of loci with dominant effects are involved. Our results demonstrate that sleep is an evolutionarily labile phenotype, highly responsive to changes in ecological conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a single species with a convergence on sleep loss exhibited by several independently evolved populations correlated with population-specific ecologies.},

Sleep is nearly ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom, yet little is known about how ecological factors or perturbations to the environment shape the duration and timing of sleep. In diverse animal taxa, poor sleep negatively impacts development, cognitive abilities and longevity. In addition to mammals, sleep has been characterized in genetic model organisms, ranging from the nematode worm to zebrafish, and, more recently, in emergent models with simplified nervous systems such as Aplysia and jellyfish. In addition, evolutionary models ranging from fruit flies to cavefish have leveraged natural genetic variation to investigate the relationship between ecology and sleep. Here, we describe the contributions of classical and emergent genetic model systems to investigate mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. These studies highlight fundamental interactions between sleep and sensory processing, as well as a remarkable plasticity of sleep in response to environmental changes. Understanding how sleep varies throughout the animal kingdom will provide critical insight into fundamental functions and conserved genetic mechanisms underlying sleep regulation. Furthermore, identification of naturally occurring genetic variation regulating sleep may provide novel drug targets and approaches to treat sleep-related diseases.},

It has been said that the development of an understanding of zero by society initiated a major intellectual advance in humans, and we have been thought to be unique in this understanding. Although recent research has shown that some other vertebrates understand the concept of the ``empty set,'' Howard et al. now show that an understanding of this concept is present in untrained honey bees (see the Perspective by Nieder). This finding suggests that such an understanding has evolved independently in distantly related species that deal with complexity in their environments, and that it may be more widespread than previously appreciated.

Some vertebrates demonstrate complex numerosity concepts\textemdash{}including addition, sequential ordering of numbers, or even the concept of zero\textemdash{}but whether an insect can develop an understanding for such concepts remains unknown. We trained individual honey bees to the numerical concepts of ``greater than'' or ``less than'' using stimuli containing one to six elemental features. Bees could subsequently extrapolate the concept of less than to order zero numerosity at the lower end of the numerical continuum. Bees demonstrated an understanding that parallels animals such as the African grey parrot, nonhuman primates, and even preschool children.
Honey bees display an understanding that zero is an empty set at the base of the number line.

Aspects of the phenomenon which are discussed include physiological changes and their anatomical location, the effects of total and selective sleep deprivation in the human and animal, and REM sleep behavior disorder, the latter with its clinical manifestations in the human. Although dreaming also occurs in other sleep phases (non-REM or NREM sleep), in the human, there is a contingent relation between REM sleep and dreaming. Thus, REM is taken as a marker for dreaming and as REM is distributed ubiquitously throughout the mammalian class, it is suggested that other mammals also dream. It is suggested that the overall function of REM sleep/dreaming is more important than the content of the individual dream; its function is to place the dreamer protagonist/observer on the topographical world. This has importance for the developing infant who needs to develop a sense of self and separateness from the world which it requires to navigate and from which it is separated for long periods in sleep. Dreaming may also serve to maintain a sense of `I'ness or ``self'' in the adult, in whom a fragility of this faculty is revealed in neurological disorders.},

The time spent in quiet sleep was negatively correlated with body size and basal metabolic rate. The latter relationship remained even after controlling for the effects of body weight. Neither the total time spent in active sleep, nor active sleep as a percentage of total sleep time was significantly correlated with body weight or metabolic rate. Altricial species spend more time in active sleep than do precocial species. The time between the onset of successive episodes of active sleep, the AS-QS cycle length, was positively correlated with body weight. For their body sizes, species that live in temperate regions have shorter AS-QS cycles than those living in tropical or sub-tropical regions. Correlations between patterns of sleep and adult brain weight probably result from the confounding effects of body weight.

This review aims at clarifying the meaning of the question and at showing the phylogenetic origin of the mammalian and avian sleep. The phylogenetic appearance of sleep can be approached through a study of the evolution of the vertebrate brain. This began as an undifferentiated dorsal nerve, which was followed by the development of an anterior simplified brain and ended with the formation of the multilayered mammalian neocortex or the avian neostriate. The successive stages in the differentiation of the vertebrate brain produced, at least, two different waking types. The oldest one is the diurnal activity, bound to the light phase of the circadian cycle. Poikilotherms control the waking from the whole brainstem, where their main sensorymotor areas lie. Mammals developed the thalamocortical lines, which displaced the waking up to the cortex after acquiring homeothermy and nocturnal lifestyle. In order to avoid competence between duplicate systems, the early waking type, controlled from the brainstem, was suppressed, and by necessity was turned into inactivity, probably slow wave sleep. On the other hand, the nocturnal rest of poikilotherms most probably resulted in rapid eye movement sleep. The complex structure of the mammalian sleep should thus be considered an evolutionary remnant; the true acquisition of mammals is the cortical waking and not the sleep.},

We find that for cetaceans sleep is characterized by USWS, a negligible amount or complete absence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and a varying degree of movement during sleep associated with body size, and an asymmetrical eye state. We then compare the anatomy of the mammalian somnogenic system with what is known in cetaceans, highlighting areas where additional knowledge is needed to understand cetacean sleep. Three suggested functions of USWS (facilitation of movement, more efficient sensory processing and control of breathing) are discussed. Lastly, the possible selection pressures leading to this form of sleep are examined, leading us to the suggestion that the selection pressure necessitating the evolution of cetacean sleep was most likely the need to offset heat loss to the water from birth and throughout life.

  abstract = {This study was designed to functionally validate earlier described criteria for visual sleep scoring with respect to acoustical stimulus threshold for arousal. A further objective was to explore the relation between electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectrum and acoustical stimulus threshold for arousal. After habituation to an acoustical stimulus (a 1,000-Hz sine tone, increasing 1.5 dB per second for 45 seconds), values for latency to arousal after acoustical stimulus onset were analyzed. Arousal was determined based on EEG and electromyographic (EMG) criteria. There was a significant effect of sleep stage, with slow wave sleep 2 (SWS-2) having higher arousal threshold than slow wave sleep 1 (SWS-1), rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and transition type sleep. This indicates that the subdivision of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in the rat into SWS-1 and SWS-2 had functional validity in this paradigm. Time of day also had a significant effect, with lower arousal threshold in the last 2 hours (ninth and tenth hour of the light period) of the 8-hour registration period. Furthermore, there was a significant effect of EEG delta power density. Epochs with high delta power had increased arousal threshold relative to epochs with low arousal threshold. The results were consistent with the notion that delta activity is an indicator of depth within NREM sleep.},

  abstract = {The negative effects of sleep deprivation on alertness and cognitive performance suggest decreases in brain activity and function, primarily in the thalamus, a subcortical structure involved in alertness and attention, and in the prefrontal cortex, a region subserving alertness, attention, and higher-order cognitive processes. To test this hypothesis, 17 normal subjects were scanned for quantifiable brain activity changes during 85 h of sleep deprivation using positron emission tomography (PET) and 18Fluorine-2-deoxyglucose (18FDG), a marker for regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRglu) and neuronal synaptic activity. Subjects were scanned prior to and at 24-h intervals during the sleep deprivation period, for a total of four scans per subject. During each 30 min 18FDG uptake, subjects performed a sleep deprivation-sensitive Serial Addition/Subtraction task. Polysomnographic monitoring confirmed that subjects were awake. Twenty-four hours of sleep deprivation, reported here, resulted in a significant decrease in global CMRglu, and significant decreases in absolute regional CMRglu in several cortical and subcortical structures. No areas of the brain evidenced a significant increase in absolute regional CMRglu. Significant decreases in relative regional CMRglu, reflecting regional brain reductions greater than the global decrease, occurred predominantly in the thalamus and prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices. Alertness and cognitive performance declined in association with these brain deactivations. This study provides evidence that short-term sleep deprivation produces global decreases in brain activity, with larger reductions in activity in the distributed cortico-thalamic network mediating attention and higher-order cognitive processes, and is complementary to studies demonstrating deactivation of these cortical regions during NREM and REM sleep.},

Sleep deprivation is known to impair a range of functions, including immune regulation and metabolic control, as well as neurocognitive processes, such as learning and memory [1]. But evidence for the role of sleep in regulating our emotional brain-state is surprisingly scarce, and while the dysregulation of affective stability following sleep loss has received subjective documentation 2, 3, any neural examination remains absent. Clinical evidence suggests that sleep and emotion interact; nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders expressing sleep disruption display corresponding symptoms of affective imbalance [4]. Independent of sleep, knowledge of the basic neural and cognitive mechanisms regulating emotion is remarkably advanced. The amygdala has a well-documented role in the processing of emotionally salient information, particularly aversive stimuli 5, 6. The extent of amygdala engagement can also be influenced by a variety of connected systems, particularly the medial-prefrontal cortex (MPFC); the MPFC is proposed to exert an inhibitory, top-down control of amygdala function, resulting in contextually appropriate emotional responses 5, 6. We have focused on this network and using functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) have obtained evidence, reported here, that a lack of sleep inappropriately modulates the human emotional brain response to negative aversive stimuli (see Supplemental data available on-line with this issue).},

However, dreaming also occurs in non-REM (NREM) sleep, characterized by prominent low-frequency activity. This challenges our understanding of the neural correlates of conscious experiences in sleep. Using high-density electroencephalography, we contrasted the presence and absence of dreaming in NREM and REM sleep. In both NREM and REM sleep, reports of dream experience were associated with local decreases in low-frequency activity in posterior cortical regions. High-frequency activity in these regions correlated with specific dream contents. Monitoring this posterior 'hot zone' in real time predicted whether an individual reported dreaming or the absence of dream experiences during NREM sleep, suggesting that it may constitute a core correlate of conscious experiences in sleep.},

Preferred lighting levels are significantly higher than today's indoor lighting standards and correspond to levels where biological stimulation can occur. The results strongly suggest that meeting biological lighting needs is very different from meeting visual needs. Results of two permanent occupants show striking differences in lighting settings, which correspond to individual circadian cycles and performance. This strengthens that present indoor lighting levels (and standards) are too low for biological stimulation. Medical research has shown that a prolonged lack of `light vitamin' can cause health problems ranging from minor sleep and performance difficulties to major depressions. This inevitably suggests that `poor' indoor lighting is the underlying cause of many of the health and performance problems. By naming this the `ill-lighting syndrome' we may well have identified the fundamental mechanism that can result in many different negative health/performance effects. Creating healthy indoor lighting can be a simple form of preventive medicine and providing a new challenge for the lighting community.},

How did humans sleep before the modern era? Because the tools to measure sleep under natural conditions were developed long after the invention of the electric devices suspected of delaying and reducing sleep, we investigated sleep in three preindustrial societies [1, 2, 3]. We find that all three show similar sleep organization, suggesting that they express core human sleep patterns, most likely characteristic of pre-modern era Homo sapiens. Sleep periods, the times from onset to offset, averaged 6.9\textendash{}8.5~hr, with sleep durations of 5.7\textendash{}7.1~hr, amounts near the low end of those industrial societies [4, 5, 6, 7]. There was a difference of nearly 1~hr between summer and winter sleep. Daily variation in sleep duration was strongly linked to time of onset, rather than offset. None of these groups began sleep near sunset, onset occurring, on average, 3.3~hr after sunset. Awakening was usually before sunrise. The sleep period consistently occurred during the nighttime period of falling environmental temperature, was not interrupted by extended periods of waking, and terminated, with vasoconstriction, near the nadir of daily ambient temperature. The daily cycle of temperature change, largely eliminated from modern sleep environments, may be a potent natural regulator of sleep. Light exposure was maximal in the morning and greatly decreased at noon, indicating that all three groups seek shade at midday and that light activation of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is~maximal in the morning. Napping occurred on~$<$7\% of days in winter and $<$22\% of days in summer. Mimicking aspects of the natural environment might be effective in treating certain modern sleep disorders.},

  abstract = {We recorded EEG from both hemispheres and documented the state of the two eyes in two species of Cetaceans (one beluga and one bottlenose dolphin) and one species of Pinnipeds (two northern fur seals). In the dolphin and beluga we found that episodes of unihemispheric slow wave sleep (USWS) were associated with asymmetry in eye state. During USWS and asymmetrical SWS the eye contralateral to the sleeping hemisphere was mostly closed or in an intermediate state while the eye contralateral to the waking hemisphere was more often open or in an intermediate state. Bilateral eye opening indicated waking in about 80\% cases and unilateral eye closure indicated USWS with an accuracy of about 75\%. Bilateral eye closure was rare (less than 2\% of the observation time) and was not necessarily associated with high amplitude SWS. In fur seals, episodes of one eye briefly opening usually occurred in the beginning of sleep episodes and lasted several minutes. Those episodes were frequently associated with lower amplitude EEG slow waves in the contralateral brain hemisphere. During most of their sleep on land, fur seals had both eyes tightly closed. No EEG asymmetry was recorded at this time. Although eye state and EEG stage are correlated in the bottlenose dolphin, beluga and fur seals, short episodes of EEG synchrony (less then 1 min) occur contralateral to an open eye and waking (a more activated EEG) activity can be present contralateral to a closed eye. The available data suggest that two functions of USWS/EEG asymmetry during SWS in Cetaceans and fur seals are multisensory control of the environment and maintenance of motion and postures of sleep. The adaptive advantages of USWS throughout the evolution of Cetaceans and Pinnipeds from terrestrial mammals to present forms could include 1) the avoidance of predators and maintenance of contact with other animals of the same species; 2) continuance of regular breathing; 3) and effective thermoregulation in the water environment.},

  abstract = {A single species of fly, Drosophila melanogaster, has been the subject of scientific research for more than one hundred years. Why does this tiny insect merit such intense scrutiny? Drosophila's importance as a research organism began with its short life cycle, ability to reproduce in large numbers, and easy-to-see mutant phenotypes. Over time, laboratory investigation revealed surprising similarities between flies and other animals at the level of genes, gene networks, cell interactions, physiology, immunity, and behavior. Like humans, flies learn and remember, fight microbial infection, and slow down as they age. Scientists use Drosophila to investigate complex biological activities in a simple but intact living system. Fly research provides answers to some of the most challenging questions in biology and biomedicine, including how cells transmit signals and form ordered structures, how we can interpret the wealth of human genome data now available, and how we can develop effective treatments for cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Written by a leader in the Drosophila research community, First in Fly celebrates key insights uncovered by investigators using this model organism. Stephanie Elizabeth Mohr draws on these ``first in fly'' findings to introduce fundamental biological concepts gained over the last century and explore how research in the common fruit fly has expanded our understanding of human health and disease.},

  doi = {10.1242/jeb.02755},
  abstract = {The hormonal regulation of feeding behaviour is well known in vertebrates, whereas it remains poorly understood in insects. Here, we report that the takeout gene is an essential component of nutritional homeostasis in Drosophila. takeout encodes a putative juvenile hormone (JH) binding protein and has been described as a link between circadian rhythm and feeding behaviour. However, the physiological role of takeout and its putative link to JH remain unknown. In this study, we show that takeout (to(1)) flies failed to adapt their food intake according to food availability and that most defects could be genetically rescued. When food is abundant, to(1) are hyperphagic, yielding to hypertrophy of the fat body. When food reappears after a starvation period, to(1) flies do not increase their food intake as much as wild-type flies. This defect in food intake regulation is partly based on the action of Takeout on taste neurons, because the sensitivity of to(1) gustatory neurons to sugars does not increase after starvation, as in wild-type neurons. This lack of regulation is also evident at the locomotor activity, which normally increases during starvation, a behaviour related to food foraging. In addition, to(1) flies lack sexual dimorphism of locomotor activity, which has previously been linked to the JH circulating level. Moreover, application of the JH analog methoprene rescues the phenotype. These results suggest that takeout plays a central role as a feeding regulator and may act by modulating the circulating JH level.},

  abstract = {Male seminal fluid proteins induce a profound remodelling of behavioural, physiological and gene signalling pathways in females of many taxa, and typically cause elevated egg production and decreased sexual receptivity. In Drosophila melanogaster, these effects can be mediated by an ejaculate 'sex peptide' (SP), which, in addition, contributes significantly to the cost of mating in females. Recent research has revealed that SP can stimulate female post-copulatory feeding, raising the possibility that the widespread female cost of mating could be due to over-feeding. In this study, we used D. melanogaster as a model to test this hypothesis. We first show that elevated post-mating feeding is dependent upon egg production and does not occur in sterile ovoD1 mutant females. This conclusion was also supported by the increase in feeding of virgin females whose egg production was experimentally elevated. We then demonstrated that sterile ovoD1 and fertile females experienced identical survival costs of mating, related to their frequency of mating and not to female feeding rate or to egg production. We conclude that female mating costs are not the result of over-feeding, but may be due to other, potentially more direct, effects of ejaculate molecules.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.cub.2013.08.055},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During active (or REM) sleep, infant mammals exhibit myoclonic twitches of skeletal muscles throughout the body, generating jerky, discrete movements of the distal limbs. Hundreds of thousands of limb twitches are produced daily, and sensory feedback from these movements is a substantial driver of infant brain activity, suggesting that they contribute to motor learning and sensorimotor integration. It is not known whether the production of twitches is random or spatiotemporally structured, or whether the patterning of twitching changes with age; such information is critical for understanding how twitches contribute to development.
RESULTS: We used high-speed videography and 3D motion tracking to assess the spatiotemporal structure of twitching at forelimb joints in 2- and 8-day-old rats. At both ages, twitches exhibited highly structured spatiotemporal properties at multiple timescales, including synergistic and multijoint movements within and across forelimbs. Hierarchical cluster analysis and latent class analysis revealed developmental changes in twitching quantity and patterning. Critically, we found evidence for a selectionist process whereby movement patterns at the early age compete for retention and expression over development.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that twitches are not produced randomly but are highly structured at multiple timescales. This structure has important implications for understanding brain and spinal mechanisms that produce twitching, and the role that sensory feedback from twitching plays in sensorimotor system development. We propose that twitches represent a heretofore-overlooked form of motor exploration that helps animals probe the biomechanics of their limbs, build motor synergies, and lay a foundation for complex, automatic, and goal-directed wake movements.},

In our present study, a modified version of the previously developed, fully computerized, close-up video/photoamplifier system was used. Results indicate that individual specimens swam fast and unidirectionally during the day, while at night, in a light\textendash{}dark cycle, they swam slowly and frequently turned. This oscillatory pattern was sustained in continuous darkness, where fluctuation in the frequency of avoiding responses was a dominant characteristic. The time structure of the ``random walk'' of Paramecium behavior was also examined by constructing and stochastically testing histograms of the interval times between specimens consecutively traversing beneath an observation point. Statistical analyses of observation data indicated that the circadian organization of the two components by individual specimens resulted in a circadian accumulation/dispersal rhythm of the entire population. It was concluded that the circadian ``traverse frequency'' rhythm principally represented this circadian accumulation/dispersal rhythm.},

  abstract = {Paramecium tetraurelia displays a behavioral response to environmental stimuli that involves changes in the direction and speed of swimming. This paper demonstrates that there are periodic variations in the frequency of behavioral responses of individual cells. The frequency of the backward swimming response undergoes repeated oscillations with a period (tau) between 40 and 50 minutes; these oscillations are only slightly affected by the temperature at which the cells have been grown. These data indicate the presence of an ultradian clock that underlies this cellular process. However, growing cells in the presence of low concentrations of LiCl perturbs the ultradian rhythm, with the periodicity being reduced to approximately 11 minutes. The LiCl effect is seen within 10\textendash{}45 minutes, depending on the concentration of LiCl used, and is completely reversible. In order to determine if the LiCl effect was due to a depletion of inositol, cells were grown in 10 mM myo-inositol for 24 hours prior to the addition of LiCl. It was found that the presence of excess inositol inhibited the perturbation of the periodicity caused by the LiCl. These results signify that Paramecium tetraurelia possesses an endogenous ultradian clock that influences the strength of the behavioral response, and the inositol signaling pathway is most likely involved in the generation of the ultradian rhythm. Therefore, the Paramecium behavioral response is an excellent model system for elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the ultradian rhythms.},

This study examined the effect of light regime on rhythmicity of motility in the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium sp., freshly isolated from the soft coral Heteroxenia fuscescens (Ehrenberg). Freshly isolated algal cells, placed under a 12-h L:12-h D cycle, exhibited motility with a diel rhythm. This motility occurred only during the period of illumination and lasted 8\textendash{}9 h, with a peak at 2.5\textendash{}4 h after lights on. Algal cells placed in an inverted light regime inverted their motility pattern. The response to the L/D regime was very precise, and even a 1-h shift backward or forward affected initiation of motility and time of its maximal peak. When placed in either constant light or dark, algal motility ceased until the L/D cycle was restored. These findings suggest that the rhythm is entrained by light cues and is not due to an endogenous circadian rhythm. Further, we provide evidence that the presence of juvenile hosts does not affect the algal motility pattern. These results offer the first evidence for the lack of impact by the host on rhythmicity of motility of free-living algal cells. The motility pattern found in freshly isolated algae may indicate the presence of light-induced diel rhythmicity in yet-to-be described free-living Symbiodinium.},

In a spectacular space experiment, the question of the existence of an endogenous clock vs. an exogenous mechanism has been studied in this organism. With the emergence of molecular analysis of circadian rhythms in plants in 1985, a circadian gene expression pattern of several nuclear and chloroplast genes was detected. Evidence is now accumulating that shows circadian control at the translational level. In addition, the gating of the cell cycle by the circadian clock has been analyzed.

For estimating the distribution F of the survival times, the product-limit estimator proposed by Kaplan and Meier (1958) has been studied extensively and it has been shown to enjoy a number of optimality properties (Wellner 1982). See Gill (1980, chaps. 1-4; 1983) for a modern treatment and for references. With censored data, bootstrapping can be carried out using two different resampling plans introduced by Efron (1981) and Reid (1981), respectively. With Efron's plan one takes a random sample with replacement from (X\textsubscript{1}, $\delta$\textsubscript{1}), ..., (X\textsubscript{n}, $\delta$\textsubscript{n}), whereas with Reid's plan one takes a random sample from the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The purpose of this article is to study the asymptotic behavior of the bootstrapped Kaplan-Meier estimator with both resampling plans. The approach adopted uses the theory of martingales for point processes. This extends our understanding of the asymptotic behavior of bootstrapped estimated distribution functions to the situation in which random censoring occurs. The uncensored case has been studied by Bickel and Freedman (1981) and Shorack (1982). The new result is used to obtain bootstrap confidence bands for a survival distribution under random censoring using Efron's approach. These bands are the only available ones that are valid even when the survival distribution has a discrete component. Further, it is demonstrated that Reid's proposal for bootstrapping does not produce asymptotically correct confidence bands. Results from simulation studies assessing the finite sample performance of the bootstrap confidence bands are included.},

  abstract = {Mating elicits profound behavioral and physiological changes in many species that are crucial for reproductive success. After copulation, Drosophila melanogaster females reduce their sexual receptivity and increase egg laying [1, 2]. Transfer of male sex peptide (SP) during copulation mediates these postmating responses [1, 3-6] via SP sensory neurons in the uterus defined by coexpression of the proprioceptive neuronal marker pickpocket (ppk) and the sex-determination genes doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru) [7-9]. Although neurons expressing dsx downstream of SP signaling have been shown to regulate postmating behaviors [9], how the female nervous system coordinates the change from pre- to postcopulatory states is unknown. Here, we show a role of the neuromodulator octopamine (OA) in the female postmating response. Lack of OA disrupts postmating responses in mated females, while increase of OA induces postmating responses in virgin females. Using a novel dsx(FLP) allele, we uncovered dsx neuronal elements associated with OA signaling involved in modulation of postmating responses. We identified a small subset of sexually dimorphic OA/dsx(+) neurons (approximately nine cells in females) in the abdominal ganglion. Our results are consistent with a model whereby OA neuronal signaling increases after copulation, which in turn modulates changes in female behavior and physiology in response to reproductive state.},

  abstract = {If we could rear genetically identical individuals from a variety of genetic backgrounds and rear them in the same environment, how much phenotypic variation between individuals of the same genotype would we see? Would different genetic backgrounds differ in their degree of variability? What would account for these differences? We used Drosophila inbred lines to address these questions focusing on variability in locomotor handedness. We show that different genotypes vary dramatically in their propensity for variability, that phenotypic variability itself, as a trait, can be heritable, and that loci affecting variability can be mapped. The genetic control of variability has received little attention in quantitative genetics despite the important role variability plays in explaining phenotypic variation between individuals., Quantitative genetics has primarily focused on describing genetic effects on trait means and largely ignored the effect of alternative alleles on trait variability, potentially missing an important axis of genetic variation contributing to phenotypic differences among individuals. To study the genetic effects on individual-to-individual phenotypic variability (or intragenotypic variability), we used Drosophila inbred lines and measured the spontaneous locomotor behavior of flies walking individually in Y-shaped mazes, focusing on variability in locomotor handedness, an assay optimized to measure variability. We discovered that some lines had consistently high levels of intragenotypic variability among individuals, whereas lines with low variability behaved as although they tossed a coin at each left/right turn decision. We demonstrate that the degree of variability is itself heritable. Using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for the degree of intragenotypic variability as the phenotype across lines, we identified several genes expressed in the brain that affect variability in handedness without affecting the mean. One of these genes, Ten-a, implicates a neuropil in the central complex of the fly brain as influencing the magnitude of behavioral variability, a brain region involved in sensory integration and locomotor coordination. We validated these results using genetic deficiencies, null alleles, and inducible RNAi transgenes. Our study reveals the constellation of phenotypes that can arise from a single genotype and shows that different genetic backgrounds differ dramatically in their propensity for phenotypic variabililty. Because traditional mean-focused GWASs ignore the contribution of variability to overall phenotypic variation, current methods may miss important links between genotype and phenotype.},

In an extreme example, a domesticated strain of Drosophila simulans harbored both strongly photopositive and strongly photonegative individuals. The particular behavior of an individual fly is not heritable and, because it persists for its lifetime, constitutes a model system for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of personality. Although all strains assayed had greater than expected variation (assuming binomial sampling), some had more than others, implying a genetic basis. Using genetics and pharmacology, we identified the metabolite transporter White and white-dependent serotonin as suppressors of phototactic personality. Because we observed behavioral idiosyncrasy in all experimental groups, we suspect it is present in most behaviors of most animals.},

We examined these relationships for morphological and life-history traits of Daphnia magna in four independent experiments using two different Moscow populations and one German population. Clones were raised under a range of food levels or individual densities. Heterozygosity was scored at five allozyme loci in two experiments and at three loci in two others. Relative differences in developmental noise among clones with different heterozygosity levels were estimated as the pooled residual variation from an analysis of variation that removed the effects of macroenvironment, clones, and their interaction. Plasticity was measured as the amount of macroenvironmental variation plus genotype-by-environment interaction variation. We found a positive correlation between developmental noise and heterozygosity, although this correlation varied among traits and experiments. This result contradicts most previous claims about these relationships. In contrast, we found that phenotypic plasticity and heterozygosity were negatively correlated for some traits. Developmental noise and phenotypic plasticity were correlated for only two traits in two different experiments. This trait-specific relationship is in concordance with previous studies. Our results could not be explained by effects of developmental time, a previously hypothesized mechanism. We propose several explanations for our results and the disparate results of others that do not require that heterozygosity be the actual cause of variation in developmental noise.},

The link between selection and phenotypic plasticity is analysed at the level of the individual. Plasticity can affect an individual's response to selection and so may modify the end result of genetic diversity evolution at population level. Genetic diversity increases the ability of populations or communities to adapt to new environmental conditions. Adaptive plasticity increases individual fitness. However this effect must be viewed from the perspective of the costs of plasticity, although these are not easy to estimate. It is becoming necessary to engage in new experimental research to demonstrate the combined effects of selection and plasticity for adaptation and their consequences on the evolution of genetic diversity.},

Stochastic fluctuations in the cellular components that determine cellular states can cause two distinct subpopulations, a property called bistability.

Although switching between states can occur within the cells' lifetime, cells can also pass their cellular state over to the next generation by a mechanism known as epigenetic inheritance and thus perpetuate the phenotypic state. Importantly, heterogeneous populations can demonstrate increased fitness compared with homogeneous populations. This suggests that microbial cells employ bet-hedging strategies to maximize survival.

Using novel technologies, we conducted an unprecedentedly detailed high-throughput analysis of sleep in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, coupled with a life-long chronic and specific sleep restriction. Our results show that some wild-type flies are virtually sleepless in baseline conditions and that complete, forced sleep restriction is not necessarily a lethal treatment in wild-type Drosophila melanogaster. We also show that circadian drive, and not homeostatic regulation, is the main contributor to sleep pressure in flies. We propose a three-partite model framework of sleep function, according to which, total sleep accounts for three components: a vital component, a useful component, and an accessory component.},

Across phyla, hormones secreted from adipose tissue act in the brain to control neural physiology and behavior to modulate sleep and metabolic state. Growing evidence suggests the fat body is a critical regulator of complex behaviors, but little is known about the genes that function within the fat body to regulate sleep. To identify molecular factors functioning in the periphery to regulate sleep, we performed an RNAi screen selectively knocking down genes in the fat body. We found that knockdown of Phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase/Pfas(Ade2), a highly conserved gene involved the biosynthesis of purines, reduces sleep and energy stores. Flies heterozygous for multiple Ade2 mutations are also short sleepers and this effect is partially rescued by restoring Ade2 to the fat body. Targeted knockdown of Ade2 in the fat body does not alter arousal threshold or the homeostatic response to sleep deprivation, suggesting a specific role in modulating baseline sleep duration. Together, these findings suggest Ade2 functions within the fat body to promote both sleep and energy storage, providing a functional link between these processes.},

  abstract = {Sleep can be altered by an organism's previous experience. For instance, female Drosophila melanogaster experience a post-mating reduction in daytime sleep that is purportedly mediated by sex peptide (SP), one of many seminal fluid proteins (SFPs) transferred from male to female during mating. In the present study, we first characterized this mating effect on sleep more fully, as it had previously only been tested in young flies under 12h light/12h dark conditions. We found that mating reduced sleep equivalently in 3-day-old or 14-day-old females, and could even occur in females who had been mated previously, suggesting that there is not a developmental critical period for the suppression of sleep by mating. In conditions of constant darkness, circadian rhythms were not affected by prior mating. In either constant darkness or constant light, the sleep reduction due to mating was no longer confined to the subjective day but could be observed throughout the 24-hour period. This suggests that the endogenous clock may dictate the timing of when the mating effect on sleep is expressed. We recently reported that genetic elimination of SP only partially blocked the post-mating female siesta sleep reduction, suggesting that the effect was unlikely to be governed solely by SP. We found here that the daytime sleep reduction was also reduced but not eliminated in females mated to mutant males lacking the vast majority of SFPs. This suggested that SFPs other than SP play a minimal role in the mating effect on sleep, and that additional non-SFP signals from the male might be involved. Males lacking sperm were able to induce a normal initial mating effect on female sleep, although the effect declined more rapidly in these females. This result indicated that neither the presence of sperm within the female reproductive tract nor female impregnation are required for the initial mating effect on sleep to occur, although sperm may serve to prolong the effect. Finally, we tested for contributions from other aspects of the mating experience. NorpA and eya2 mutants with disrupted vision showed normal mating effects on sleep. By separating males from females with a mesh, we found that visual and olfactory stimuli from male exposure, in the absence of physical contact, could not replicate the mating effect. Further, in ken/barbie male flies lacking external genitalia, courtship and physical contact without ejaculation were also unable to replicate the mating effect. These findings confirmed that the influence of mating on sleep does in fact require male/female contact including copulation, but may not be mediated exclusively by SP transfer.},

Sleep is thought to be controlled by two main processes: a circadian clock that primarily regulates sleep timing and a homeostatic mechanism that detects and responds to sleep need. Whereas abundant experimental evidence suggests that sleep need increases with time spent awake, the contributions of different brain arousal systems have not been assessed independently of each other to determine whether certain neural circuits, rather than waking per se, selectively contribute to sleep homeostasis. Using the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we found that sustained thermogenetic activation of three independent neurotransmitter systems promoted nighttime wakefulness. However, only sleep deprivation resulting from activation of cholinergic neurons was sufficient to elicit subsequent homeostatic recovery sleep, as assessed by multiple~behavioral criteria. In contrast, sleep deprivation resulting from activation of octopaminergic neurons suppressed homeostatic recovery sleep, indicating that wakefulness can be dissociated from accrual of sleep need. Neurons that promote sleep homeostasis were found to innervate the central brain and motor control regions of the thoracic ganglion. Blocking activity of these neurons suppressed recovery sleep but did not alter baseline sleep, further differentiating between neural control of sleep homeostasis and daily fluctuations in the sleep/wake cycle. Importantly, selective activation of wake-promoting neurons without engaging the sleep homeostat impaired subsequent short-term memory, thus providing evidence that neural circuits that regulate~sleep homeostasis are important for behavioral plasticity. Together, our data suggest a neural circuit model involving distinct populations of wake-promoting neurons, some of which are involved in homeostatic control of sleep and cognition.},

Here, we describe the construction and use of the Activity Recording Capillary Feeder or CAFE (ARC), a machine-vision (automated image tracking)-based system for the integrated measurement of sleep and feeding in individual Drosophila. Flies feed on liquid food from a microcapillary, and consumption is measured by tracking the liquid meniscus over time. Sleep measurements are obtained from positional tracking of individual animals, and arousal threshold can be determined by vibrational stimulus response. Using this system, a single computer and experimenter can track diverse behaviors from up to 60 individual flies in a single integrated system. The ARC is efficiently assembled with minimal training, and each experiment can be run for up to $\sim$7 d, with a total setup and breakdown time of $\sim$2 h.},

We also show that alterations in food intake are not induced by dietary restriction or by a null mutation of the fly insulin receptor substrate chico.

Reduction of either dietary yeast or sugar can reduce mortality and extend life span, but by an amount that is unrelated to the calorie content of the food, and with yeast having a much greater effect per calorie than does sugar.

  abstract = {The Drosophila somatic sex-determination regulatory pathway has been well studied, but little is known about the target genes that it ultimately controls. In a differential screen for sex-specific transcripts expressed in fly heads, we identified a highly male-enriched transcript encoding Takeout, a protein related to a superfamily of factors that bind small lipophilic molecules. We show that sex-specific takeout transcripts derive from fat body tissue closely associated with the adult brain and are dependent on the sex determination genes doublesex (dsx) and fruitless (fru). The male-specific Doublesex and Fruitless proteins together activate Takeout expression, whereas the female-specific Doublesex protein represses takeout independently of Fru. When cells that normally express takeout are feminized by expression of the Transformer-F protein, male courtship behavior is dramatically reduced, suggesting that male identity in these cells is necessary for behavior. A loss-of-function mutation in the takeout gene reduces male courtship and synergizes with fruitless mutations, suggesting that takeout plays a redundant role with other fru-dependent factors involved in male mating behavior. Comparison of Takeout sequences to the Drosophila genome reveals a family of 20 related secreted factors. Expression analysis of a subset of these genes suggests that the takeout gene family encodes multiple factors with sex-specific functions.},

For example, the likelihood to initiate feeding might be influenced by an animal's commitment to other behaviors. Here, we examine the modulation of feeding behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, and identify a pair of interneurons in the ventral nerve cord that is activated by stimulation of mechanosensory neurons and inhibits feeding initiation, suggesting that these neurons suppress feeding while the fly is walking. Conversely, inhibiting activity in these neurons promotes feeding initiation and inhibits locomotion. These studies demonstrate the mutual exclusivity between locomotion and feeding initiation in the fly, isolate interneurons that influence this behavioral choice, and provide a framework for studying the neural basis for behavioral exclusivity in Drosophila.},

  abstract = {Trade-offs between reproduction and life span are ubiquitous, but little is known about their underlying mechanisms. Here we combine treatment with the juvenile hormone analog (JHa) methoprene and experimental evolution in Drosophila melanogaster to study the potential role of juvenile hormone (JH) in mediating such trade-offs at both the physiological and evolutionary level. Exposure to JHa in the larval medium (and up to 24 h posteclosion) increased early life fecundity but reduced life span of normal (unselected) flies, supporting the physiological role of JH in mediating the trade-off. This effect was much smaller for life span, and not detectable for fecundity, in fly lines previously bred for 19 generations on a medium containing JHa. Furthermore, these selection lines lived longer than unselected controls even in the absence of JHa treatment, without a detectable reduction in early life fecundity. Thus, selection for resistance to JHa apparently induced some evolutionary changes in JH metabolism or signaling, which led to longer life span as a correlated response. This supports the hypothesis that JH may mediate evolution of longer life span, but\textemdash{}contrary to our expectation\textemdash{}this apparently does not need to trade-off with fecundity.},

  abstract = {The innate immune response protects numerous organisms, including humans, from the universe of pathogenic molecules, viruses and micro-organisms. Despite its role in promoting pathogen resistance, inappropriate activation and expression of NF$\kappa$B and other immunity-related effector molecules can lead to cancer, inflammation, and other diseases of aging. Understanding the mechanisms leading to immune system activation as well as the short- and long-term consequences of such activation on health and lifespan is therefore critical for the development of beneficial immuno-modulating and longevity-promoting interventions. Mechanisms of innate immunity are highly conserved across species, and we take advantage of genetic tools in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to study the effects of acute and chronic activation of immunity pathways on pathogen resistance and general fitness of adult flies. Our findings indicate that fat body specific overexpression of a putative pathogen recognition molecule, peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-LE), is sufficient for constitutive up-regulation of the immune response and for enhanced pathogen resistance. Primary components of fitness are unaffected by acute activation, but chronic activation leads to an inflammatory state and reduced lifespan. These phenotypes are dependent on the NF$\kappa$B-related transcriptional factor, Relish, and they establish a mechanistic basis for a link between immunity, inflammation, and longevity.},

  abstract = {It has become increasingly clear that life-history patterns among the vertebrates have been shaped by the plethora and variety of immunological risks associated with parasitic faunas in their environments. Immunological competence could very well be the most important determinant of life-time reproductive success and fitness for many species. It is generally assumed by evolutionary ecologists that providing immunological defences to minimise such risks to the host is costly in terms of necessitating trade-offs with other nutrient-demanding processes such as growth, reproduction, and thermoregulation. Studies devoted to providing assessments of such costs and how they may force evolutionary trade-offs among life-history characters are few, especially for wild vertebrate species, and their results are widely scattered throughout the literature. In this paper we attempt to review this literature to obtain a better understanding of energetic and nutritional costs for maintaining a normal immune system and examine how costly it might be for a host who is forced to up-regulate its immunological defence mechanisms. The significance of these various costs to ecology and life history trade-offs among the vertebrates is explored. It is concluded that sufficient evidence exists to support the primary assumption that immunological defences are costly to the vertebrate host.},

  abstract = {It has been known for some 70 years that restricting the food intake of laboratory rats extends their mean and maximum life span. In addition, such life extension has been observed over the years in many other species, including mice, hamsters, dogs, fish, invertebrate animals, and yeast. Since this life-extending action appears to be due to a restricted intake of energy, this dietary manipulation is referred to as caloric restriction (CR). CR extends life by slowing and/or delaying the ageing processes. The underlying biological mechanism responsible for the life extension is still not known, although many hypotheses have been proposed. The Growth Retardation Hypothesis, the first proposed, has been tested and found wanting. Although there is strong evidence against the Reduction of Body Fat Hypothesis, efforts have recently been made to resurrect it. While the Reduction of Metabolic Rate Hypothesis is not supported by experimental findings, it nevertheless still has advocates. Currently, the most popular concept is the Oxidative Damage Attenuation Hypothesis; the results of several studies provide support for this hypothesis, while those of other studies do not. The Altered Glucose\textendash{}Insulin System Hypothesis and the Alteration of the Growth Hormone\textendash{}IGF-1 Axis Hypothesis have been gaining favor, and data have emerged that link these two hypotheses as one. Thus, it may now be more appropriate to refer to them as the Attenuation of Insulin-Like Signaling Hypothesis. Finally, the Hormesis Hypothesis may provide an overarching concept that embraces several of the other hypotheses as merely specific examples of hormetic processes. For example, the Oxidative Damage Attenuation Hypothesis probably addresses only one of likely many damaging processes that underlie aging. It is proposed that low-intensity stressors, such as CR, activate ancient hormetic defense mechanisms in organisms ranging from yeast to mammals, defending them against a variety of adversities and, when long-term, retarding senescent processes.},

  abstract = {This book was written for statisticians, computer scientists, geographers, researchers, and others interested in visualizing data. It presents a unique foundation for producing almost every quantitative graphic found in scientific journals, newspapers, statistical packages, and data visualization systems. While the tangible results of this work have been several visualization software libraries, this book focuses on the deep structures involved in producing quantitative graphics from data. What are the rules that underlie the production of pie charts, bar charts, scatterplots, function plots, maps, mosaics, and radar charts? Those less interested in the theoretical and mathematical foundations can still get a sense of the richness and structure of the system by examining the numerous and often unique color graphics it can produce. The second edition is almost twice the size of the original, with six new chapters and substantial revision. Much of the added material makes this book suitable for survey courses in visualization and statistical graphics. From reviews of the first edition: "Destined to become a landmark in statistical graphics, this book provides a formal description of graphics, particularly static graphics, playing much the same role for graphics as probability theory played for statistics." Journal of the American Statistical Association "Wilkinson's careful scholarship shows around every corner. This is a tour de force of the highest order." Psychometrika "All geography and map libraries should add this book to their collections; the serious scholar of quantitative data graphics will place this book on the same shelf with those by Edward Tufte, and volumes by Cleveland, Bertin, Monmonier, MacEachren, among others, and continue the unending task of proselytizing for the best in statistical data presentation by example and through scholarship like that of Leland Wilkinson."

  abstract = {Sleep is present and tightly regulated in every vertebrate species in which it has been carefully investigated, but what sleep is for remains a mystery. Sleep is also present in invertebrates, and an extensive analysis in Drosophila melanogaster has shown that sleep in fruit flies show most of the fundamental features that characterize sleep in mammals. In Drosophila, fly sleep consists of sustained periods of quiescence associated with an increased arousal threshold. Fly sleep is modulated by several of the same stimulants and hypnotics that affect mammalian sleep. Moreover, like in mammals, fly sleep shows remarkable interindividual variability. The expression of several genes involved in energy metabolism, synaptic plasticity, and the response to cellular stress varies in Drosophila between sleep and wakefulness, and the same occurs in rodents. Brain activity also changes in flies as a function of behavioral state. Furthermore, Drosophila sleep is tightly regulated in a circadian and homeostatic manner, and the homeostatic regulation is largely independent of the circadian regulation. After sleep deprivation recovery sleep in flies is longer in duration and more consolidated, as indicated by an increase in arousal threshold and fewer brief awakenings. Finally, sleep deprivation in flies impairs vigilance and performance. Because of the extensive similarities between flies and mammals, Drosophila is now being used as a promising model system for the genetic dissection of sleep. Over the last few years, mutagenesis screens have isolated several short sleeping mutants, a demonstration that that single genes can have a powerful effect on a complex trait like sleep.},

  abstract = {Sleep in Drosophila shares many features with mammalian sleep, but it remains unknown whether spontaneous and evoked activity of individual neurons change with the sleep/wake cycle in flies as they do in mammals. Here we used calcium imaging to assess how the Kenyon cells in the fly mushroom bodies change their activity and reactivity to stimuli during sleep, wake, and after short or long sleep deprivation. As before, sleep was defined as a period of immobility of $>$5 min associated with a reduced behavioral response to a stimulus. We found that calcium levels in Kenyon cells decline when flies fall asleep and increase when they wake up. Moreover, calcium transients in response to two different stimuli are larger in awake flies than in sleeping flies. The activity of Kenyon cells is also affected by sleep/wake history: in awake flies, more cells are spontaneously active and responding to stimuli if the last several hours (5\textendash{}8 h) before imaging were spent awake rather than asleep. By contrast, long wake ($\geq$29 h) reduces both baseline and evoked neural activity and decreases the ability of neurons to respond consistently to the same repeated stimulus. The latter finding may underlie some of the negative effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance and is consistent with the occurrence of local sleep during wake as described in behaving rats. Thus, calcium imaging uncovers new similarities between fly and mammalian sleep: fly neurons are more active and reactive in wake than in sleep, and their activity tracks sleep/wake history.},

Results: Our unsupervised approach detects the cornerstones of human sleep (wakefulness, deep and rem sleep) with around 80\% accuracy based on data from a single EEG channel. There are some difficulties in generalizing results across sleep labs. Conclusion: Using data from a single electrode is sufficient for reliable continuous sleep staging.

  abstract = {Behavioral states alternate between wakefulness (wk), rapid eye movement (rem) and non-rem (nrem) sleep at time scale of hours i.e., light and dark cycle rhythms and from several tens of minutes to seconds (i.e., brief awakenings during sleep). Using statistical analysis of bout duration, Markov chains of sleep-wk dynamics and quantitative EEG analysis, we evaluated the influence of light/dark (ld) changes on brain function along the sleep-wk cycle. Bout duration (bd) histograms and Kaplan-Meier (km) survival curves of wk showed a bimodal statistical distribution, suggesting that two types of wk do exist: brief-wk (wkb) and long-wk (wkl). Light changes modulated specifically wkl bouts, increasing its duration during active/dark period. In contrast, wkb, nrem and rem bd histograms and km curves did not change significantly along ld cycle. Hippocampal eeg of both types of wk were different: in comparison wkb showed a lower spectral power in fast gamma and fast theta bands and less emg tone. After fitting a four-states Markov chain to mice hypnograms, moreover in states transition probabilities matrix was found that: in dark/active period, state-maintenance probability of wkl increased, and probability of wkl to nrem transition decreased; the opposite was found in light period, favoring the hypothesis of the participation of brief wk into nrem-rem intrinsic sleep cycle, and the role of wkl in SWS homeostasis. In conclusion, we propose an extended Markov model of sleep using four stages (wkl, nrem, rem, wkb) as a fully adequate model accounting for both modulation of sleep-wake dynamics based on the differential regulation of long-wk (high gamma/theta) epochs during dark and light phases.},

However, it is not known whether these human-defined features capture the most important aspects of behavior for phenotypic comparison or whether they are sufficient to discover new behaviors. Here we show that four basic shapes, or eigenworms, previously described for wild-type worms, also capture mutant shapes, and that this representation can be used to build a dictionary of repetitive behavioral motifs in an unbiased way. By measuring the distance between each individual's behavior and the elements in the motif dictionary, we create a fingerprint that can be used to compare mutants to wild type and to each other. This analysis has revealed phenotypes not previously detected by real-time observation and has allowed clustering of mutants into related groups. Behavioral motifs provide a compact and intuitive representation of behavioral phenotypes.},

These features are derived from across the scientific time-series analysis literature, and include summaries of time series in terms of their correlation structure, distribution, entropy, stationarity, scaling properties, and fits to a range of time-series models. After computing thousands of features for each time series in a training set, those that are most informative of the class structure are selected using greedy forward feature selection with a linear classifier. The resulting feature-based classifiers automatically learn the differences between classes using a reduced number of time-series properties, and circumvent the need to calculate distances between time series. Representing time series in this way results in orders of magnitude of dimensionality reduction, allowing the method to perform well on very large data sets containing long time series or time series of different lengths. For many of the data sets studied, classification performance exceeded that of conventional instance-based classifiers, including one nearest neighbor classifiers using euclidean distances and dynamic time warping and, most importantly, the features selected provide an understanding of the properties of the data set, insight that can guide further scientific investigation.},

Phenotype measurements frequently take the form of time series, but we currently lack a systematic method for relating these complex data streams to scientifically meaningful outcomes, such as relating the movement dynamics of organisms to their genotype or measurements of brain dynamics of a patient to their disease diagnosis. Previous work addressed this problem by comparing implementations of thousands of diverse scientific time-series analysis methods in an approach termed highly comparative time-series analysis. Here, we introduce hctsa, a software tool for applying this methodological approach to data. hctsa includes an architecture for computing over 7,700 time-series features and a suite of analysis and visualization algorithms to automatically select useful and interpretable time-series features for a given application. Using exemplar applications to high-throughput phenotyping experiments, we show how hctsa allows researchers to leverage decades of time-series research to quantify and understand informative structure in time-series data.},

  abstract = {Optogenetic techniques enable one to target specific neurons with light-sensitive proteins, e.g., ion channels, ion pumps, or enzymes, and to manipulate their physiological state through illumination. Such artificial interference with selected elements of complex neuronal circuits can help to determine causal relationships between neuronal activity and the effect on the functioning of neuronal circuits controlling animal behavior. The advantages of optogenetics can best be exploited in genetically tractable animals whose nervous systems are, on the one hand, small enough in terms of cell numbers and to a certain degree stereotypically organized, such that distinct and identifiable neurons can be targeted reproducibly. On the other hand, the neuronal circuitry and the behavioral repertoire should be complex enough to enable one to address interesting questions. The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a favorable model organism in this regard. However, the application of optogenetic tools to depolarize or hyperpolarize neurons through light-induced ionic currents has been difficult in adult flies. Only recently, several variants of Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) have been introduced that provide sufficient light sensitivity, expression, and stability to depolarize central brain neurons efficiently in adult Drosophila. Here, we focus on the version currently providing highest photostimulation efficiency, ChR2-XXL. We exemplify the use of this optogenetic tool by applying it to a widely used aversive olfactory learning paradigm. Optogenetic activation of a population of dopamine-releasing neurons mimics the reinforcing properties of a punitive electric shock typically used as an unconditioned stimulus. In temporal coincidence with an odor stimulus this artificially induced neuronal activity causes learning of the odor signal, thereby creating a light-induced memory.},

Examples of frequency-dependent selection are rare, especially when attempting to describe the genetic basis of the phenotype under selection. Here we show frequency-dependent selection in a well-known natural genetic polymorphism affecting fruitfly foraging behaviour. When raised in low nutrient conditions, both of the naturally occurring alleles of the foraging gene (fors and forR) have their highest fitness when rare\textemdash{}the hallmark of negative frequency-dependent selection. This effect disappears at higher resources levels, demonstrating the role of larval competition. We are able to confirm the involvement of the foraging gene by showing that a sitter-like mutant allele on a rover background has similar frequency-dependent fitness as the natural sitter allele. Our study represents a clear demonstration of frequency-dependent selection, and we are able to attribute this effect to a single, naturally polymorphic gene known to affect behaviour.},

  abstract = {Stress is considered to be an important cause of disrupted sleep and insomnia. However, controlled and experimental studies in rodents indicate that effects of stress on sleep\textendash{}wake regulation are complex and may strongly depend on the nature of the stressor. While most stressors are associated with at least a brief period of arousal and wakefulness, the subsequent amount and architecture of recovery sleep can vary dramatically across conditions even though classical markers of acute stress such as corticosterone are virtually the same. Sleep after stress appears to be highly influenced by situational variables including whether the stressor was controllable and/or predictable, whether the individual had the possibility to learn and adapt, and by the relative resilience and vulnerability of the individual experiencing stress. There are multiple brain regions and neurochemical systems linking stress and sleep, and the specific balance and interactions between these systems may ultimately determine the alterations in sleep\textendash{}wake architecture. Factors that appear to play an important role in stress-induced wakefulness and sleep changes include various monominergic neurotransmitters, hypocretins, corticotropin releasing factor, and prolactin. In addition to the brain regions directly involved in stress responses such as the hypothalamus, the locus coeruleus, and the amygdala, differential effects of stressor controllability on behavior and sleep may be mediated by the medial prefrontal cortex. These various brain regions interact and influence each other and in turn affect the activity of sleep\textendash{}wake controlling centers in the brain. Also, these regions likely play significant roles in memory processes and participate in the way stressful memories may affect arousal and sleep. Finally, stress-induced changes in sleep-architecture may affect sleep-related neuronal plasticity processes and thereby contribute to cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric disorders.},

Lines selected for increased longevity have often been shown to perform as well as or superior to control lines in life history, stress resistance and behavioural traits when tested in the laboratory. Functional senescence in longevity selected lines has also been shown to occur at a slower rate. However, it is known that performance in a controlled laboratory setting is not necessarily representative of performance in nature. In this study the effect of ageing, environmental temperature and longevity selection on performance in the field was tested. Flies from longevity selected and control lines of different ages (2, 5, 10 and 15days) were released in an environment free of natural food sources. Control flies were tested at low, intermediate and high temperatures, while longevity selected flies were tested at the intermediate temperature only. The ability of flies to locate and reach a food source was tested. Flies of intermediate age were generally better at locating resources than both younger and older flies, where hot and cold environments accelerate the senescent decline in performance. Control lines were better able to locate a resource compared to longevity selected lines of the same age, suggesting that longevity comes at a cost in early life field fitness, supporting the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of ageing.},

Feeding Drosophila melanogaster diets high in sugar has increasingly been used as an experimental model to understand the physiological effects of unhealthy, contemporary human diets. Several metabolic parameters and physiological responses to nutrition are known to be dependent on the sex of the animal. However, sexual dimorphism in the responses to high-sugar diets in fruit flies has not been examined. Here we show that a high-sugar diet in Drosophila melanogaster elicits sexually dimorphic effects on feeding behaviour, starvation resistance and lifespan. Females feed less on such diets, while males feed more, and these feeding responses may have secondary consequences. Females, more than males, gain the ability to resist periods of starvation from high-sugar diets, indicating that the female response to excess sugar may be geared towards surviving food shortages in early life. At the same time, female lifespan is more susceptible to the detrimental effects of high sugar diets. Our study reveals differences between Drosophila sexes in their responses to sugar-rich diets, indicating the fruit fly could be used as a model to understand the sexually dimorphic features of human metabolic health.},

This alternative is based on Bateman's principle, that males gain fitness by increasing their mating success whilst females increase fitness through longevity because their reproductive effort is much higher. Consequently, I predict that females should invest more in immunity than males. The extent of this dimorphism is determined by the mating system and the genetic correlation between males and females in immune traits. In support of my arguments, I mainly use studies on insects that share innate immunity with vertebrates and have the advantage that they are easier to study.},

A finer resolution of the relationship between male and female behaviour was obtained by a transitional analysis of the females\&apos; responses with the various male activities. 6. Both fertilised females and aging virgins showed extrusion of the ovipositor as the modal response. 7. Fending and curling occurred rarely and did not lead to any changes in male behaviour. 8. Kicking and flicking were deduced to be responses to different aspects, or intensities of courtship. Kicking was largely contingent upon attempted copulation, whereas flicking resulted from licking and sometimes non-courtship behaviours. Flicking is also correlated with a high level of locomotor activity. 9. Extrusion by aged virgins and fertilised females was associated with the wing vibration display of the male, and in both groups was followed, rather than preceded, by attempted copulation. However, the aged virgins were receptive, whereas the fertilised females were not. Extrusion was interpreted as a means of physically preventing copulation, rather then producing long term inhibition of courtship. 10. It is suggested that the ontogeny of extrusion is associated with development in the female\&apos;s egg producing system. 11. The temporary reluctance of the 3 day old virgin females, exemplified by their kicking, was discussed in the context of EWING\&apos;S (1969) concept of a \&apos;reference oscillator\&apos; used by the female to identify the auditory signals produced by a conspecific.},

  abstract = {The ability to select a better option from multiple acceptable ones is important for animals to optimize their resources. The mechanisms that underlie such decision-making processes are not well understood. We found that selection of egg-laying site in Drosophila melanogaster is a suitable system to probe the neural circuit that governs simple decision-making processes. First, Drosophila females pursue active probing of the environment before depositing each egg, apparently to evaluate site quality for every egg. Second, Drosophila females can either accept or reject a sucrose-containing medium, depending on the context. Last, communication of the ``acceptability'' of the sucrose-containing medium as an egg-laying option to the reproductive system depends on the function of a group of insulin-like peptide 7 (ILP7)\textendash{}producing neurons. These findings suggest that selection of egg-laying site involves a simple decision-making process and provide an entry point toward a systematic dissection of this process.
Experiments show how flies make complex decisions when laying eggs, choosing surfaces containing sucrose only when other options are not available.

In this video article, we describe an automated assay to measure the effect of hunger or satiety on olfactory dependent food search behavior in the adult fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. In a light-tight box illuminated by red light that is invisible to fruit flies, a camera linked to custom data acquisition software monitors the position of six flies simultaneously. Each fly is confined to walk in individual arenas containing a food odor at the center. The testing arenas rest on a porous floor that functions to prevent odor accumulation. Latency to locate the odor source, a metric that reflects olfactory sensitivity under different physiological states, is determined by software analysis. Here, we discuss the critical mechanics of running this behavioral paradigm and cover specific issues regarding fly loading, odor contamination, assay temperature, data quality, and statistical analysis.},

This absorbing book challenges this fundamental notion by showing how objects themselves, specifically scientific instruments, can express knowledge. As he considers numerous intriguing examples, Davis Baird gives us the tools to "read" the material products of science and technology and to understand their place in culture. Making a provocative and original challenge to our conception of knowledge itself, Thing Knowledge demands that we take a new look at theories of science and technology, knowledge, progress, and change. Baird considers a wide range of instruments, including Faraday's first electric motor, eighteenth-century mechanical models of the solar system, the cyclotron, various instruments developed by analytical chemists between 1930 and 1960, spectrometers, and more.},

  abstract = {Experiment is widely regarded as the most distinctive feature of natural science and essential to the way scientists find out about the world. Yet there has been little study of the way scientists actually make and use experiments. The Uses of Experiment fills this gap in our knowledge about how science is practised. Presenting 14 original case studies of important and often famous experiments, the book asks the questions: What tools do experimenters use? How do scientists argue from experiments? What happens when an experiment is challenged? How do scientists check that their experiments are working? Are there differences between experiments in the physical sciences and technology? Leading scholars in the fields of history, sociology and philosophy of science consider topics such as the interaction of experiment; instruments and theory; accuracy and reliability as hallmarks of experiment in science and technology; realising new phenomena; the believability of experiments and the sort of knowledge they produce; and the wider contexts on which experimentalists draw to develop and win support for their work. Drawing on examples as diverse as Galilean mechanics, Victorian experiments on electricity, experiments on cloud formation, and testing of nuclear missiles, a new view of experiment emerges. This view emphasises that experiments always involve choice, tactics and strategy in persuading audiences that Nature resembles the picture experimenters create.},

  abstract = {Quantifying behavior is crucial for many applications in neuroscience. Videography provides easy methods for the observation and recording of animal behavior in diverse settings, yet extracting particular aspects of a behavior for further analysis can be highly time consuming. In motor control studies, humans or other animals are often marked with reflective markers to assist with computer-based tracking, yet markers are intrusive (especially for smaller animals), and the number and location of the markers must be determined a priori. Here, we present a highly efficient method for markerless tracking based on transfer learning with deep neural networks that achieves excellent results with minimal training data. We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in a broad collection of experimental settings: mice odor trail-tracking, egg-laying behavior in drosophila, and mouse hand articulation in a skilled forelimb task. For example, during the skilled reaching behavior, individual joints can be automatically tracked (and a confidence score is reported). Remarkably, even when a small number of frames are labeled (\$$\backslash$approx 200\$), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.},

Here, we show that the space of shapes adopted by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is low dimensional, with just four dimensions accounting for 95\% of the shape variance. These dimensions provide a quantitative description of worm behavior, and we partially reconstruct ``equations of motion'' for the dynamics in this space. These dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli. Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively ``steering'' the worm in real time.},

  abstract = {Female Drosophila melanogaster frequently mate with multiple males in nature as shown through parentage analysis. Although polyandry is well documented, we know little about the timing between mating events in wild Drosophila populations due to the challenge of following behaviours of individual females. In this study, we used the presence of a male reproductive protein that is transferred to the female during mating (Sex Peptide, SP) to determine whether she had recently mated. We sampled females throughout the day, conducted control matings to determine the decay rate of SP within the female reproductive tract and performed computer simulations to fit the observed proportion of mated females to a nonhomogenous Poisson process that defined the expected time between successive matings for a given female. In our control matings, 100\% of mated females tested positive for SP 0.5 h after the start of mating (ASM), but only 24\% tested positive 24 h ASM. Overall, 35\% of wild-caught females tested positive for the presence of SP. Fitting our observed data to our simple nonhomogenous Poisson model provided the inference that females are mating, on average, approximately every 27 h (with 95\% credibility interval 23\textendash{}31 h). Thus, it appears that females are mating a bit less frequently that once per day in this natural population and that mating events tend to occur either early in the morning or late in the afternoon.},

Wound healing was assessed by pathological analysis of wound by counting fibroblasts, capillary vessels, polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PNLs), and by measuring radiolabeled immunoglobulin G (IgG) amount in wound area by radio-pharmaceutical and immunoscintigraphic procedures. The number of fibroblasts and capillary vessels were higher in control and Se groups than in sleep deprivation and nicotine groups, and the number of PNLs and the radiolabeled polyvalent IgG levels were higher in SD and nicotine groups than in control and Se groups. The results suggest that SD and nicotine may delay wound healing and that Se supplementation may accelerate wound healing by preventing nicotine-induced oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.},
