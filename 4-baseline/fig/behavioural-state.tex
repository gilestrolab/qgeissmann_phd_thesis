	  \caption[Behavioural state modulation]{\ctit{Behavioural state modulation.}
	\textbf{A}, Six, randomly selected, 48-hours, individual behavioural time series.
	The background colour indicates behaviour state whilst the solid black line shows the average relative position with respect to the food (\ie{} $Position = 0  \Longrightarrow$ the fly is on the food").
	Both variables are scored at a frequency of 1~min$^{-1}$. 
	The three behavioural states are quiescent (q, grey), micro-movement (m, green) and walking (w, blue).
	The grey dashed line  at $Position = 0.5$ shows the location of the `virtual beam', that would emulate DAM data.
	\textbf{B}, Population averages of the proportion of time engaged in one of the three behavioural state over 24~hours.
	Shaded areas show a 95\% bootstrap resampling confidence interval around the mean. 
	\textbf{C}, Distribution of the $position$ variable computed separately for each behavioural state.
	Within each group (sex), densities are scaled to reflect
	the overall occurrence of each state $b$ over the space $x$ (\ie{} $\int_{x=0}^{1}D(b,x) = P(b)$ and $1 = \sum_{b} P(b)$).
	In \textbf{B} and \textbf{C}, $N_{male} = 485$ and $N_{female} = 881$.
