	  \caption[Comparison to DAM]{\ctit{Comparison to DAM.}
	Scored immobility (\textbf{A}--\textbf{C}) and sleep (\textbf{D}--\textbf{F}) for male (blue) and female (red) flies.
	\textbf{A} and \textbf{D}, Population average of activity (\textbf{A}) and sleep (\textbf{D}) over a circadian day (average of each 30 minutes in five consecutive days, modulus 24 hours).
	\textbf{B} and \textbf{E}, Spearman's $\rho$ for activity (\textbf{B}) or sleep (\textbf{E}) between DAM and ethoscope scored for each 30 minutes in a day. 
	High values denote a strong correlation between both methods.
	\textbf{C} and \textbf{F}, Immobility and sleep fragmentation, respectively.
	Each point shows data from a single individual, with its total number of bouts in 5 days, on the y-axis, and the average duration of all its bout, on the x-axis. 
	L  and D phase bouts were computed separately.
	Shaded areas in \textbf{A} and \textbf{D} show a 95\% bootstrap resampling confidence interval around the average. 
	Contour lines in \textbf{C} and \textbf{F} are density levels. 
	$N_{male} = 485$ and $N_{female} = 881$.
