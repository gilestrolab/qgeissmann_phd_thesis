	\rev{\textbf{A}, Overall distribution of walked distance for all one-minute bouts that were
	\emph{not} scored as quiescent, for males (blue) and females (red).
	\textbf{B}, Distribution of walked distance per hour of the day. 
	The black vertical line shows the value of threshold $T_d$ used to score bouts as micromovement or waling (see eq.~\ref{eq:behav-scoring})
	The label of each facet represents the hour of the day from which the data was used (\eg{} 0 means $ZT \in [0,1)$).
	$N_{male} = 485$ and $N_{female} = 881$. The X axis is square-root-transformed.}
