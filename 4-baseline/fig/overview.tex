		\textbf{C} and \textbf{D}, Average sleep over five days for each individual.
		Flies were sorted in decreasing order, from top to bottom, with respect to their overall sleep amount.
		Each row in \textbf{A} and \textbf{B} is aligned to the bar representing the same animal, in \textbf{C} and \textbf{D}, respectively.
%		 B and D show male and females data, respectively.
		The top (\textbf{A} and \textbf{C}) and bottom (\textbf{B} and \textbf{D}) subfigures represent males and females, respectively and $N_{male} = 485$ and $N_{female} = 881$.
%		The highlighted females, in C, are selected animals that were further scrutinised. %TODO fig...
