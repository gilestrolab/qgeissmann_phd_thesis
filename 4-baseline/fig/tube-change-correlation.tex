	\textbf{A}, Population averages of time spent in quiescence (q), micro-movement (m) and walking (w).
	On day~7 (grey rectangle) animals were transferred into fresh tubes and systematically interspersed to a new location (within experimental incubators and ethoscopes).
	\textbf{B}, Means of Spearman's $\rho$ showing the correlation of average time spent engaged in a behaviour between day~1 and all subsequent days, by the same animal.
	In addition to the three behavioural states, the average position when quiescent is also shown.
	Shaded areas, in \textbf{A}, and error bars, in \textbf{B}, show 95\% bootstrap resampling confidence intervals around the mean.
	$N_{male} = 204$ and $N_{female} = 242$.
