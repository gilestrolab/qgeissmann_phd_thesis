		\textbf{A}, Kaplanâ€“Meier plot showing the proportion of animals alive since the onset of the treatment.
		Females and males are shown on the top and bottom, respectively.
		The grey rectangle in the background coincides with the permissive time window of stimulus delivery.
		Stimuli were delivered to animals each time they had been immobile for 20 consecutive seconds. %%%%%%%%
		Controls animals (grey) were undisturbed and spatially interspersed (in the neighbouring tube) with the treated individuals (plum).
		\textbf{B}, Effect of number of stimuli on lifespan, for the treatment group. Lines show the result of a linear regression.
		\textbf{C}, Effect of the overall average time spent in a behavioural state (and position), during the experiment, on the subsequent lifespan. 
		Behavioural variables are represented as labelled rows (q: quiescence, m: micro-movement, w:walking, pos.: position\emd{}from the food, 0, to the cotton wool, 1).
		Straight lines in \textbf{B} and \textbf{C}, are the result of a linear regression.
		Shaded areas represent 95\% confidence intervals.
		$N_{sex,treatment} > 97~\forall~sex \times treatment$.
